The original meouzer.github.io was deleted and reincarnated. The deep copying code is now better, and a lot of code was simply eliminated in part because I found out how to 
do it better, but mostly because I no longer support IE11. There is now a clear straight line from deep-copying JSON like objects and the aphelion of deep copying ES5 and ES6 
classes.
