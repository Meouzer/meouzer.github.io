	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	 <p>                      
           This article is based solely on original W3 source material at
           <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/</a>.
	</p>

	
	<p class="display">
		A HTML <dfn>selector</dfn> is a formal expression, algebraic in nature, that represents the set/class 
		of HTML elements that meet the criteria specified by the expression.
	  </p>	  
	  <p>	
		If <var>G</var> is an HTML selector and <var>g</var> is an HTML element, then by 
		definition all the following mean the same.		
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<var>g</var> is an element/member of <var>G</var>.
		</li>
		<li><var>g</var> meets the criteria of <var>G</var>.</li>
				
		<li><var>g</var> matches <var>G</var>.</li>
		<li><var>G</var> selects <var>g</var>.</li>
	</ol>
	  
	 <p>
	 	The one the author likes the best is the first because it leads to the least 
		awkward terminology
	 	for describing complex selectors.	 
	 </p> 
	  
	  
	  <p>As we shall see the criteria for the selector <var>div.myclass</var> is that an element must be a <var>div</var>
	  	with class <var>myclass</var>. So its <dfn>class</dfn>, the set of elements that it represents, is the set of 
	  	all divs with class <var>myclass</var>. Note that description of the criteria and the description its class are
	  	pretty much the same: so either may be used to describe the selector. 
	  </p>
	  
	  
	  <p>
	  	Now we give an overview of the different types of selector. &sub; represents the inclusion symbol.
	  </p>
	  <p class="display" style="display:table;text-align:center;margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; font-size: .9em">
            Simple Selectors &sub; Product Selectors &sub; Combined Selectors &sub; HTML Group Selectors = 
            All HTML Selectors &sub; CSS group selectors = CSS Selectors
	</p>
	<p>
		So all simple selectors are product selectors. All product selectors are combined selectors. All combined selectors
		are group selectors. The HTML group selectors form the set of all HTML selectors. All HTML group selectors
		are CSS group selectors. 
	</p>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Construction of HTML Selectors</h2>
		<ol class="display mt1" style="padding-left:2em;margin-top:2em">
            <li>We start with the <dfn>simple selectors</dfn>. 
            	<ul>
            		<li>They are explicitly/officially specified in the section with the same name.</li>
            	</ul>            	
            </li>
            <li>            
            	<dfn>Product selectors</dfn> are obtained by the concatenation  of simple selectors without space 
				in-between.
            	<ul>
            		<li>
            			If <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> are simple selectors,
            			then <var>xyz</var> is a product selector.
            		</li>
            		<li>
            			The members of <var>xyz</var> is the set of HTML elements that are simultaneously members
            			of <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> and <var>z</var>. Thus <var>xyz</var> is the intersection
            			of <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> and <var>z</var>.
            		</li>
            	</ul>
             </li>
            <li>
            	<dfn>Combined selectors</dfn> are the results of binary operations, called <dfn>combinators</dfn>
            	applied to the product selectors.  The combinators are          	
            	<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;margin-left:3em">
            	    <li>The white space character</li>
            		<li><var>&gt;</var></li>
            		<li> <var>+</var></li>
            		<li><var>~</var></li>
            	</ol>
            	<ul>
            		<li>So if <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var> are product selectors
            			then <var>X Y</var>, <var>X+Y</var>, and <var>X~Y</var> are <var>combined selectors</var>.
            			<ul>
            				<li>
            					 <var>X Y</var> is the set of <var>Y</var> elements that are a descendant
            					 of some <var>X</var> element.
            				</li>
            				<li>
            					<var>X&gt;Y</var> is the class of <var>Y</var> elements that are a child of
            					some <var>X</var> element
            				</li>            				
            				<li>
            					<var>X~Y</var> is the set of <var>Y</var> elements that are a subsequent
            					sibling of some <var>X</var> element.
            				</li>
            				<li>
            					<var>X+Y</var> is the set of <var>Y</var> elements that are the next
            					immediate sibling of some <var>X</var> element.
            				</li>							
            			</ul>
            		</li>
            	</ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            	Then the unions/groups of combined selectors, indicated by comma, form the set of all
            	<var>HTML group selectors</var>.
            	<ol>
            		<li>
            			If <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, and <var>C</var> are combined selectors, then their
            			grouping/union <var>A, B, C</var> is an HTML group selector. It represents the
            			set of all elements that meet at least one of the criteria of the three.   
            			More simply <var>A, B, C</var> is the set of HTML elements that are elements
            			of at least one of <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, and <var>C</var>.
            		</li>
            	</ol>
            </li>
            </ol>
	</section>
	          
      	
	<p>For future reference keep in mind that </p>
        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>
                Every simple selector is a product selector. A product of one.
            </li>
            <li>Every product selector is a combined selector. A combination of one.</li>
            <li>Every combined selector is a group selector. A group of one.</li>
            <li>Since HTML selectors don't include pseudo selectors, HTML Selectors don't form the full set of all CSS selectors </li>
	</ul>
<!--
	<p>	
		If <var>G</var> is an HTML selector and <var>h</var> is an HTML element, then by 
		definition all the following mean the same.		
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><var>h</var> meets the criteria of <var>G</var>.</li>
		<li><var>h</var> is an element of <var>G</var>.</li>		
		<li><var>h</var> matches <var>x</var>.</li>
		<li><var>h</var> selects <var>x</var>.</li>
	</ol>
	 
	<p>
		Also keep in mind that it is very convient to conflate an HTML selector <var>G</var> with its class, the set of all html elements
		that meet its criteria. Now we can express three previous
		definitions more simply.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><var>G H</var> is the set of all <var>H</var> elements that are 
		descendants of some <var>G</var> element.</li>
		<li><var>G&gt;H</var> is the set of all <var>H</var> elements that are a child of some <var>G</var> element.</li>
		<li><var>G~H</var> is the set of all <var>H</var> elements that are siblings of some <var>G</var> element.</li>
		<li><var>G+H</var> is the set of all <var>H</var> elements that are the next immediate sibling of some <var>G</var> element.</li>

<section id="Simple-Selectors">
	<h2>Simple Selectors</h2>	
	<p>
		The next table lists all <dfn>simple selectors</dfn> in the third column and categorizes them in the first column. 
		The second column either gives the name of the selector, or in the case of a parameterized selector, the subcategory.
		The name or subcategory includes the word <i>selector</i>, which we had to leave out for brevity. So for example:
	</p>
	<ul class="ml2">		
		<li>the name of the <var>*</var> selector is the <var>universal selector</var>;</li>
		<li>
			The only child selector is the <var>:only-child</var> selector.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <var>substring selector</var> is a little bit of a misnomer, but it's ok to use anyway. It
			has two parameters and you don't actually get a selector until you specify its parameters.
			So <var>[foo*="bar"]</var> is an actual substring selector: the two parameters have been explicitly
			specified with <var>foo</var> as the attribute and <var>bar</var> as the 
			substring. If <var>bar</var>
			has double quotes they will need to be escaped before placing in the outer quotes. 
		</li>

				Consider the product selector whose factors are <var>:first-child</var>, <var>:hover</var>, 
				<var>#mydiv</var>, and <var>.myclass</var>.
				We can obtain the product selector by concatenating these four factors in twenty-four ways, but we show only three.

				<li><var>:first-child:hover#myid.myclass</var></li>
				<li><var>#myid.myclass:first-child:hover</var></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				All three concatenations represent the same product or intersection. 
				This product matches all elements that are a <var>first child</var>, 
				are of the class <var>myclass</var>, are being <var>hovered</var> on, 
				and have id <var>#myid</var>.		
			</p>
			<p>We can prepend a type selector like <var>div</var> as the first factor, and again an intersection is represented.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><var>div:first-child.myclass:hover#myid</var></li>
				<li><var>div:first-child:hover#myid.myclass</var></li>
				<li><var>div#myid.myclass:first-child:hover</var></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				All three product selectors are identical because each represents the HTML collection of 
				all <var>divs</var> that are a <var>first child</var>, are of the class
				<var>myclass</var>, are being <var>hovered on</var>, and have id <var>#myid</var>.

	<p class="display">
		One of the rules of product selectors is that if the universal selector or a type selector is a factor, it must be listed as the
		first factor. Except for this caveat, order of factors isn't important.

	<h3>Combined Selectors</h3>
		<p>The following table is review. A description of the set of element 
		represented is given. You might try
		and give the criteria. For example the descendant selector criteria is that an element must be an F element
		that is a descendant of some E element. </p>
		
		<table class="web">

			<tr><th colspan="4">Combined Selectors<br><span style="font-size:.9em">(E is a combined selector, F is a product selector)</span></th></tr>
			<tr><td>Combinator Name</td><td>Combinator</td><td style="text-align:center">Combined<br>Selector</td><td>Matching HTML Collection</td></tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody style="padding:.5em">
		<tr><th>Descendant</th><td style="text-align:center">(white space)</td><td style="text-align:center">E F</td><td>All F elements that are 
			descendants of E elements</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Child</th><td style="text-align:center">&gt;</td><td style="text-align:center">E &gt; F</td><td>All F elements that are children of E elements</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Adjacent Sibling</th><td style="text-align:center">+</td><td style="text-align:center">E + F</td><td>All F elements that are the very next sibling of an E element</td></tr>
		<tr><th>General Sibling</th><td style="text-align:center">~</td><td style="text-align:center">E ~ F</td><td>All F elements that are a following sibling of an E element</td></tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>		
		<p>
			<dfn>Combined selectors</dfn> are obtained from product selectors by applying combinators. Write out a sequence
			of product selectors and write combinators in-between. The combinators are space as 
			descendant
			combinator <var>&gt;</var> as child combinator, <var>+</var> as adjacent sibling combinator,
			and <var>~</var> as general sibling combinator.
			
			OK! Here's a list of product selectors.
		</p>
		<div style="border:medium maroon ridge; padding:.5em 2em .5em 2em"> 
			<ol>
				<li class="mth mbh"><var>div:first-child</var>
					<ul>
						<li>Selects all <var>divs</var> that are a <var>first child</var>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="mth mbh">
					<var>span[foo="bar"]:only-child </var>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Selects all <var>spans</var> with attribute <var>foo</var> and string value <var>"bar"</var>.
							Example <var>&lt;span foo="bar" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;</var>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li class="mth">
					<var>var.myclass</var>
					<ul>
						<li>Selects all elements of type <var>var</var> having class <var>myclass</var> </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
				Write these out in order and place the combinators space and <var>&gt;</var> 
				in-between
				the first two and last two respectively. You get the combined selector.
			</p>
			
			<var class="centerTable">div:first-child&ensp; span[foo="bar"]:only-child &ensp; &gt; &ensp; var.myclass</var>
			
			<p>
				To interpret this, you always work backwards. 
			</p>
			<p style="margin-left:2em">
				This combined selector selects any element that is a <var>var</var> with class <var>myclass</var> 
				that is a <var>child</var> of an only child <var>span</var> that has a <var>foo</var> 
				attribute 
				whose value is <var>"bar"</var> that is in turn a <var>descendent</var> of a <var>div</var> 
				that is the first child in its parent. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			To understand spacing, the descendent combinator is a space, but you can have white space around it.
			Likewise the other combinators can have more white space around them.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The reader should keep in mind that <i>Adjacent Sibling</i> and <i>General Sibling</i> are oxymoronic. 
			Proper language dictates that a general sibling could be any sibling previous or subsequent, while an adjacent sibling
			could also  be previous or subsequent. Lets emphasize that only subsequent siblings are allowed by these two combinators. 
			These two terms
			are officially standardized and so can't be changed to proper terms such as <i>next sibling</i> or <i>following sibling</i>.
		</p>
		
		<p>It's a hole is CSS that you can't access previous siblings. </p>

	<h2>HTML Group Selectors</h2>
	<p>
		A HTML group selector is formally, a comma separated list of combined selectors. It represents the union or grouping
		of the individual combined selectors. That's it and there isn't anything more to say. However, meouzer as a 
		Siamese 
		is rather talkative. If <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var> are combined selectors (which includes product 
		selectors and simple selectors).
		then <var>x, y, z</var> is a group selector. It represents the union of the three combined selectors. It's criteria
		is that an element must lie in at least one of the three. 
	</p>
			
	<p style="border:thin maroon ridge;margin-left:2em;margin:2em" >
		<var class="centerTable">div, span, var</var> 
		<span class="centerTable">is the selector that corresponds to the HTML collection of all 
		<var>divs</var>, <var>spans</var>, and <var>vars</var>.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		Lets look at the group selector for proper combined selectors.
	</p>
	<div style="border:medium maroon ridge;padding:.5em 2em .5em 2em">
		The union of the following combined selectors
			
		<ol>
			<li><var>.myclass[foo] ~ span</var> </li>
			<li>
				<var>p:empty + :nth-child(2)</var>
			</li>
			<li>
				<var>:first-child &gt; div#myid</var>
			</li>			
		</ol>
		<br>
		can be grouped in any order, such as
		
			<var class="centerTable">.myclass[foo] ~ span,&ensp; p:empty + :nth-child(2),&ensp; :first-child &gt; div#myid</var>
		<br>	
		It selects all elements that meet at least one of the following criteria.
		<ol>
			<li>
				is a <var>span</var> that is a general sibling of some element of class <var>.myclass</var> 
				that in turn has a <var>foo</var> attribute.
			</li>
			<li>
				is a <var>second child</var> that is the adjacent sibling of some empty paragraph.

	<h2>Pseudo Elements and Pseudo Selectors</h2>
	<p>
		Logical portions of the web page that can't be accessed by the DOM are called <dfn>abstract elements</dfn>.		
	</p>
	<p>
		Officially a <dfn>pseudo element</dfn> is a formal notation whose name stands for a type of
		abstract element. For example, <var>::first-line</var> is a pseudo element that stands for first lines. By appending this particular pseudo 
                element to the end of a combined HTML selector <var>E</var>, we obtain a pattern <var>E::fist-line</var>, called a <dfn> pseudo selector</dfn>, 
                that matches all first lines of elements of <var>E</var>. 
	</p>
        <p class="display" style="display:table;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
            A <dfn>pseudo selector</dfn> is the concatenation of an HTML combined selector with a pseudo element. 
        </p>
	<table class="web" id="Pseudo-Elements">
		<thead style="padding:.5em">
			<tr><th colspan="3">Pseudo Elements and Pseudo Selectors<br><span style="font-size:.9em">(E is a combined HTML selector)</span>
			</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Pseudo Element</td><td>Pseudo Selector</td><td>Selection Criteria for Abstract Elements</td></tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody style="padding:.5em">
		<tr><td>::first-line</td><td>E::first-line</td><td>is the first line of some E element</td></tr>
		<tr><td>::first-letter</td><td>E::first-letter</td><td>is the first letter of some E element</td></tr>
		<tr><td>::before</td><td>E::before</td><td>is generated content at the start of an E element's innerHTML</td></tr>
		<tr><td>::after</td><td>E::after</td><td>is generated content at the end some E element's innerHTML</td></tr>		
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>
 		Single colons can also be used, which is best because some modern browsers don't recognize the double semicolon. 
 		<!-- The before and after pseudo
 		elements will be discussed in the styling appendix. -->
	</p>	
	<p>
		Let's take the combined selector <var>div:last-child &gt; span</var> and append the pseudo element 
		<var>:first-line</var> to get.
		<var class="centerTable">div:last-child &gt; p:first-line</var> 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This is the pseudo selector that selects all <var>first lines</var> of <var>
		paragraphs</var> that are a 
		<var>child</var> of a <var>div</var> that is a <var>last child</var>.	
	</p>
	
	<p>Let's take a look at :before. The style div:before{content:"Insert at beginning of Every Div "}
		will insert the string "Insert at beginning of Every Div " at the start of every div's
		innerHTML.

	<h2>CSS Group Selectors and CSS Selectors</h2>
	<p>
		The grouping of any number of HTML combined selectors and pseudo selectors is called a <dfn>CSS group selector</dfn>.
		It represents the union of the individual selectors: all the elements that meet the criteria of at least one
		of the individual selectors. The CSS group selectors form the set of all CSS selectors as displayed in the
		following diagram.
	</p>
	
	<img alt="not available" src="Selectors.svg" style="width:500px;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em" class="centerTable">
	
	<p>
		It just remains to give examples of proper CSS selectors. <dfn>Homogeneous</dfn> means alike in some sense.
		Combined selectors are like other combined selectors, and pseudo selectors are like other pseudo selectors,
		but combined selectors and pseudo selectors are not like each other. 
	</p>
	
	<div class="ml2">
	<p>
		All the following are CSS selectors.
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<var>div, span, var</var> 
				<ul>
					<li>is a homogenous union of HTML selectors</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<var>div::first-line, span::first-letter, var::before</var>

				<var>div, span::first-letter </var>
				<ul>
					<li>is a non-homogenous union of HTML selectors and pseudo selectors.</li>
				</ul> 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Of course in the place of the <var>div</var>, <var>span</var>, and <var>var</var> we could have used combined 
			HTML selectors of any complexity.

	<h3>Common Misunderstandings</h3>
		<p>
			Most likely because W3 is so haphazard, people get pseudo classes, pseudo elements,
			and pseudo selectors confused with each other. Even W3 and MDN get confused.
		</p>	
		<p>
			We have already seen the pseudo classes such as <var>:fisrt-child</var> in the <i>Simple Selectors</i>
			section.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#pseudo-classes">W3 Pseudo Classes</a>. 
			The pseudo-class concept is introduced to permit selection based on information that lies outside 
			of the document tree or that cannot be expressed using the other simple selectors. 
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			This quote is blatantly false. According to it the pseudo class and simple selector 
			<var>:first-child</var> is based on information outside the document tree. Wrong!
			No information outside the document tree
			describes its selection/criteria. It's only by examining the document tree that you can tell
			whether a element is a first child or not.
		</p>
		<p>Now let's see how MDN goes off the deep end.</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			A CSS 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" >pseudo-class</a> 
			is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
			For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.
			<br>
			<span style="margin-left:25em;">Mozilla Developer Network</span>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Again recall that <var>:first-chld</var> is a pseudo class. That an element is a first child really can't be considered
			to be a state of  the element and certainly not any more than the attribute selectors. That I am a first child
			has nothing to do with my state. The fact that I have brown hair does have something to do with my state.
		</p>
		<p>
			The quote messes up again by suggesting that <var>:first-child</var> is not a selector: it's just a keyword
			added to an actual selector. Wrong!
		</p>
		<p>
			The only thing you can say about the pseudo classes is that they are the simple selectors left over after you consider the
			universal selector, the type selectors, and the attribute selectors. You can't give a simple independent
			description of this: at least no one has.		
		</p>
		<p>
			Another thing is to realize is that <var>pseudo selectors</var> arise from <var>pseudo elements</var>
			and so are closely related but not the same. Furthermore, pseudo classes are something else.
			All pseudo classes are listed in the <i>Simple Selectors</i> table.
		</p>	
		<!-- <p>
			Author's that aren't careful will claim that <var>pseudo classes</var> such as
			<var>:first-child</var> are either <var>pseudo elements</var> or <var>pseudo selectors</var>. 
			The weight of evidence is clear! There are only four <var>pseudo elements</var> and we 
			went over all four of them.
