	<!-- <p class="display" style="text-decoration:line-through">
		This article introduces the <i>context evaluation factory string</i>, which when evaluated with <var>eval</var> produces
		an in place <i>context evaluation factory</i>, which when called on a context object produces an <i>evaluator</i>,
		with context dictated by the context object, which
		when called on a function copies the function into the evaluator's context. All the functions created
		by an evaluator form an <i>evaluation module</i>: They all see and can use the evaluator's context.
		In particular the outer context of each function copy is the same as the context of the evaluator.

			An <dfn>evaluator</dfn> is a function, that takes a function and uses <var>eval</var> on it to

		<dt>Parent Evaluator</dt>

			A <dfn>context evaluation factory</dfn> is a function that takes an input parameter

		So that the CEF and evaluator do not introduce unwanted outer context for the copies of

		<h2>Scope and Context</h2>
	<p>
		We take our definitions of <i>scope</i> and <i>context</i> from careful readings of
		<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)">Wikipedia: Scope</a>
		and 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jscript/2007/07/26/scope-chain-of-jscript-functions/">
			Scope Chain and Activation Objects
		</a>,
		taking their nuances into account. Multiple authors put a lot of thought into the concepts of scope and context.
		We do not allow multiple meanings for either term and insist on precision: to do otherwise is simply wishy-washy. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The reader is warned that the view that scope is all that is visible, is very wrong. It's wrong because it
		makes scope ambiguous and does not leave a separate and precise meaning for context. We insist
		on non ambiguous precise language that covers all the important concepts that actually occur in copying
		functions with evaluators.

		<h4>Test Your Understanding</h4>

				Are the global scope and the global context the same?
				<ul><li>Yes!</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Can two different scopes overlap?

					<li>
						No! Never!						
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Can two different contexts overlap?
				<ul>
					<li>
						Yes they can. Sans hidden variables, the global scope is in every context.
						Generally, sans hidden variables, a function that is ancestor to two functions has scope that
						belongs to the context of both functions.
					</li>					
				</ul>

			<li>
				What is most closely related to visibility of variables? Scope or Context?
				<ul>
					<li>Context! 
						<ul>
							<li>Let's hammer this one home.</li>
							<li>There are more variables visible to a function than its scope.</li>

	<h2>How to Copy a Function</h2>
	<p>
		Copying a function means to create another function with the same text. Both source and target of the
		copy will have equivalent scopes. However, their outer contexts are dictated by their locations, or
		points of definition, whence the outer contexts generally differ. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To copy a function, you stringify it and then use <var>eval</var> on the resulting string. <dfn>Stringify</dfn>
		means that you obtain a string by surrounding the function with 
		parentheses. 
	</p>
	
	<div id="div" class="codeBox simple centerTable" data-codeNumbers="true">
		<header class="codeHeader">Example - Copy a function with eval<div class="codeListing"></div></header>
		<div class="numberShield colorLightBurlywood"></div>
		
		// In some scope A
		var z = 1;	
		const sum = function(a,b){return a + b + z;}
		const sumString = "(" + sum + ")";
		
		(function()
		{
			// Inside some scope B. 
			var z = 10;
			
			const sumCopy = eval(sumString);
		
			// Line 6 is, via eval expansion, the same as writing 
			// const sumCopy = function(a,b){return a + b + z;} in place 
			// on the same line 6.

			alert(sumCopy(1,2)); // = 1 + 2 + 10 = 13
		})();
				
	</div>
	<p>
		sumCopy is a reference to a function defined on the right side of line 6.
		We will think of sumCopy as a function except in technical situations
		where it's important to realize that sumCopy is just a reference to
		a function. Keep in mind that the context/outer-context of the function is not
		determined by where the reference is defined, but by where the function is defined.
		In this case they're the same, but it will get wild later on.
	</p>	
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Evaluators</h2>
	<p>
		An <dfn>evaluator</dfn> is a function that takes a function as its single argument, copies the function, and
		returns the copy. 
	</p>
	<div id="div" class="codeBox simple centerTable" data-codeNumbers="true">
		<header class="codeHeader">Example - Copy a function with an evaluator<div class="codeListing"></div></header>
		<div class="numberShield colorLightBurlywood"></div>
		
		// define an evaluator
		const evaluator = function(func){return eval('(' + func + ')');}
		
		// copy an anonymous function
		// sum is the copy of function(a, b){return a + b;}
		
		const sum = evaluator(function(a, b){return a + b;}); 
		
		alert(sum(1,2)); // 1 + 2 = 3		
	</div>
	<p>
		Now imagine on line 1 that the text of <var>func</var> is expanded in place to produce the copy, 
		because that's what actually happens. Thus the copy is nested inside the evaluator, 
		i.e., the 
		parent of the copy is the evaluator. The copy therefore inherits the context of the evaluator.
		In particular, the variable <var>func</var> as a member of the context of the evaluator is also
		a member of the context of the copy. Even though the copy doesn't use <var>func</var>, <var>func</var>
		is still in context, i.e., it's still available for use by the copy. So let's actually see the copy
		use <var>func</var> in the following listing.		
	</p>
	
	<div id="div" class="codeBox simple centerTable" data-codeNumbers="true">
		<header class="codeHeader">Example - A copy inherits the evaluator's context<div class="codeListing"></div></header>
		<div class="numberShield colorLightBurlywood"></div>
		
		// define an evaluator. 
		const evaluator = function(func){return eval('(' + func + ')');}
		
		// copy an anonymous function that uses func
		const sum = evaluator(function(a, b){alert(func); return a + b;}); 
		
		alert(sum(1,2)); 
		// alerts "function(a, b){alert(func); return a + b;}" before alerting 3.		
	</div>
	<p>
		So this is BAD! Forcing the variable <var>func</var> into the context of the copy that the copy might accidently
		use is bad. Forcing <var>func</var> into the context of the copy that might override another variable
		<var>func</var> of the same name that the copy actually wants to use is bad. 
	</p>
	<p class="display">
		So what we just learned is that an evaluator should introduce no context of its own, i.e., an evaluator
		should have empty scope. Yes! Its easy to write an evaluator with empty scope. The evaluator simply 
		doesn't declare any parameters (or other variables).
	</p>
	<div id="div" class="codeBox simple centerTable" data-codeNumbers="true">
		<header class="codeHeader">Example - An evaluator with empty scope<div class="codeListing"></div></header>
		<div class="numberShield colorLightBurlywood"></div>
		
		// define an evaluator with empty scope. 
		// arguments[0] is the function to be copied.
		const evaluator = function(){return eval('(' + arguments[0] + ')');}
		
		const sum = evaluator(function(a, b){return a + b;}); 
		
		alert(sum(1,2)); // alerts  3	
	</div>	
	<p>
		Above <var>sum</var> defined on line 2 is a reference to a function defined on line 1
		while evaluator executed. While we will still call <var>sum</var> a function copy, keep 
		in mind that all function copies are actually references to the true copies defined at 
		at the location where <var>eval</var> creates it.
	</p>

<section>
	<h2>Providing Context to Function Copies</h2>
	<p>
		In Meouzer's magical evaluator paradigm of function copying using eval to expand function text in place
		to accomplish amazing things, it's the parent of the evaluator
		whose scope provides needed context to the copies created by the evaluator.
	</p>
	<p>
		We want to copy the following three functions to a particular location and supply the needed context
		variables <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>function(value) { a = value; }</li>
		<li>function() {return a; }</li>
		<li>function() {return a * b; }</li>
	</ol>
	
	<div id="div" class="codeBox simple centerTable" data-codeNumbers="true">
		<header class="codeHeader">Example - Providing Copies with Context<div class="codeListing"></div></header>
		<div class="numberShield colorLightBurlywood"></div>
		
		// getEvaluator is the parent to the evaluator returned on line 4. Its 
		// scope provides context to the copy functions returned by the evaluator.
				
		// In some scope A
		function getEvaluator()  
		{
			// set up some context for function copy on line 4
			var a = 1;
			var b = 2;
			
			// return an evaluator
			return function(){return eval('('+arguments[0]+')');}
		}
		
		(function()
		{
			// In some scope B thematically miles apart from scope A	
			const evaluator = getEvaluator();
		
			// copy three functions into the evaluator's context
			const setA = evaluator(function(value){a = value;});
			const getA = evaluator(function(){return a;});
			const product = evaluator(function(){return a * b;});
	
			// Make sure the variables declared in the evaluator parent
			// are in context of the functions that evaluator copied.
			
			var a = -100;  // but try to confuse the evaluator and its copies
			var b = -200; 
			
			setA(100);
			alert(getA());      // 100
			alert(product()); // a*b = 100 * 2 = 200	
		})();
	
		
	</div>
	<p>
		The evaluator parent needs to be careful with its scope. If for example, after line 3, the declaration
		<var>var helperVariable = { };</var> is made, then <var>helperVariable</var> is in the context of all function
		copies, <var>setA()</var>, <var>getA()</var>, and <var>product()</var>. As noted before, that would be BAD! 
	</p>
	<p class="display">
		Of course, colloquially speaking <var>setA</var>, <var>getA</var>, and <var>product</var> are functions.
		However, with the utmost
		technical precision in mind, are <var>setA</var>, <var>getA</var>, and <var>product</var> really functions?
		The answer is no because they are all references to functions, each of which was defined on line 4
		at <!--the second--> return statement. Why is this nuanced distinction important? It's important because if you
		want to determine the outer-context of <var>setA</var>, <var>getA</var>, and <var>product</var>
		you have to look at line 4 where they are defined. You will find that they all have the same outer
		context. Looking at lines 7, 8, or 9 tells you nothing about their outer context. So the variables
		on lines 2 and 3 are in their outer context, but the variables on lines 9 and 10 are not in their
		outer context.

	<h2>Context Evaluation Factories</h2>
		<p>
			
		</p>		
	<!-- <p> <mark>is this correct???</mark>
		A <dfn>context evaluation factory</dfn> is a function that takes a context object, uses the
		context object to define 
		an parent evaluator (parent function to an evalulator) with the needed scope as defined by the context object, calls the parent evaluator 
		to obtain the evaluator, and immediately returns
		the evaluator. So the grandparent of the evaluator is the factory. Of course by now we know that
		the factory like the evaluator should have empty scope.
	</p>-->
	<p>
		The <dfn>context object</dfn> is a literal object. The names of its keys are the names of the variables
		that are to be put into context for the function copies. The key values are the values for the corresponding
		variables. For example with the context object <var>{a:1, b:new Date()}</var>, the variables <var>var a = 1</var>,
		and <var>var b = new Date()</var> are forced into the context of the function copies created by the evaluator.

	<!-- <p>
		The location of the context evaluation factory makes a difference because the context of that location

		copy is the same as the evaluator's context, but of course the function copy overrides with its scope.

		<h3>Locally Scoped Context Evaluation Factories</h3>
		<p>
			The one and only globally scoped context evaluation factory might do exactly what you want,
			and might not. In fact you probably want a local, not global, scope forced into the outer
			context of evaluator function copies. No problem! You just rewrite <var>ceFactory</var> at the local scope in question.
			Of course that's just copying <var>ceFactory</var> and we know that can be accomplished be using <var>eval</var>
			on the stringification <var style="white-space:nowrap">const cefString = '(' + ceFactory + ')'</var>.

	<h2>Evaluation Modules</h2>
	<p>
		The set of all function references created by an evaluator is called an <dfn>evaluation module</dfn>.
		The members of the module can work harmoniously using the same outer context, i.e., the context
		of the evaluator. If one member changes the value of a variable in the evaluator's 
		context, the other members see the change: this is true even if the function references themselves are
		scattered across wildly different scopes (remember the actual functions which are referenced live in
		the evaluators context). One member can use another member if the latter
		is visible to the former.
	</p>
		<div id="div" class="codeBox simple centerTable">
		
		// Create an evaluator with a = 1, and b = 2 in context.
							
		const evaluator = (function(a, b)
		{
			return function(){return eval('(' + arguments[0] + ')');};
			}).call(null, 1, 2);
			
		// create three members of an evaluation module.
		// some of which use the others.
				
		const sum = evaluator(function(){return a + b;});	
		const scale = evaluator(function(f){a *= f; b *= f;});
		const average = evaluator(function(){return sum()/2;});
			
		// test it out
		scale(10);
		alert(sum());       // 10 + 20 = 30
		alert(average()); // (10 + 20)/2 	= 15
