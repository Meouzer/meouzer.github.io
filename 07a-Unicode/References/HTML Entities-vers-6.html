	<h2>Introduction</h2>	
		<p>
			The origianl goal was to wirte an HTML/JavaScript editor of HTML, which is shelved for article <mark>???</mark>. 
			It truns out that a miniscule knowlege of Uncicode allows a minisucle improvement of the editor, and knowing more
			unicode doesn't do any good at all. However, this got me interested in Unicode. Unicode is a very complicated subject,
			so I just reserached some of its simpler aspects to get a basic feel. The reader shouldn't take this article as being
			any more than that. Readers with intermediate to expert knowledge of Unicode probably won't get anything out of this article. 			
		</p>	
		<p>
			Of the three UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, only UTF-16 is discussed to any extent. On reason for this is the author's 
			emphasis on JavaScript, which always acts as though UTF-16 is used.
		</p>	
		
		
		
		<!-- <p>
			The structure of Unicode space should be our first step except for the fact that surrogates are part of its structure
			and referenced a lot.
			So it's a good idea to know about surrogates in advance. Since surrogates are the primary mechanism of UTF-16 encoding
			we need to get to UTF-16 encoding as quickly as possible to put surrogates into context. This will also give a preview
			of things go come.		
		</p> -->		
		<!-- 
		<p class="display">
			Somtimes somethng is so obvious that a special phrase is needed for emphasis. <br><br>
			We shall use the adjective <dfn>canonical</dfn> as the adjective phrase <var>"the unique obvious and trival"</var>.			
		</p>
		-->
		<p style="text-decoration:line-through">
			The next section has a collection of excellent Unicode references.

			tells you all you need to know. Unicode specs will define concepts its own way, and will probably contradict itself later.
			For example, I wanted to define <i>abastact character</i>, but the difficulties/contradictions that O'Reilley mentions in the reference
			below put me off. However, it turns out that if one reads everything, then sometimes a clear understanding emerges.

			<h3>Definitions and Notations</h3>			
			<section>
				<h4>Canonical</h4>
				<p>
				The term <dfn>canonical</dfn> is used as a synonym of <i>salient</i>. So canonical can refer to any of the following.				
				</p>
				<ol style="column-count:3;-moz-column-count:3; -webkit-column-count: 3;" >
					<li style=" margin-top:0">the most noticiable</li>
					<li>the most important</li>
					<!-- <li>the main</li> -->
					<!-- <li>the prinicipal</li> -->
					<!-- <li>the major</li> -->
					<!-- <li>the chief</li> -->
					<li>the primary</li>
					<li>the most obvious</li>
					<li>the most obiouis and trivial</li>
				</ol>		
				<p>				
					In the surrogate math section, the canonical mappings are not obvious, even though they are obtained by  "following your nose", 
					so <i>canonical</i> there means the <i>most important</i>. Every where else it means <i>obvious and trivial</i>. When that's 
					the meaning, details will not necessarily be provided.				
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>				
				<h4>Function Notation</h4>					
				<p>
					The notatoin <dfn>x &in; X</dfn> means x is an element of of the set X. Let's look at the notation.
					<span class="center">
						m:X &rarr; Y, <span class="rule">m(x) = x + 1</span> 
						<span class="condition">(if x &in; X)</span>
					</span>
					This means that m is a map from the set X to the set Y. After this may come the rule or formula for the map,
					written in green. Then after this may come a description of the elements for which the formula holds, written
					in maroon. Also X is called the <dfn>domain</dfn> of the map.
				</p>			
				<ol>
					
					<li>
						if x &in; X, then m(x) is the <dfn>image</dfn> of x.
					</li>
					<li>
						m(X) denotes the <dfn>range</dfn> or <dfn>image</dfn> of X. It's the set of all elements y of Y for which 
						there is an element of x of X for which m(x) = y. In set notation m(X) = {m(x): x &in; X}.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>If m is one-one then there is an inverse map from the maps image back to it's domain.</p>
						<div class="center">m<sup>-1</sup>:m(X) &rarr; X, 
						 	<span class="rule">m<sup>-1</sup>(m(x)) = x,</span>
						 	<span class="condition">(if x &in; X)</span>
						 </div>
						 <p>It is also true that</p>
						<div class="center">
						 	<span class="rule">m(m<sup>-1</sup>(y)) = y,</span>
						 	<span class="condition">(if y &in; m(X))</span>
						 </div>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						If m is one to one and onto, then m is an <dfn>equivalence</dfn>. Also if m is a canonicl map, then m is a 
						<dfn>canonical equivalence</dfn>.
					</li>
				</ol>				
			</section>	
				
			<section>
				<h4>Ranges</h4>
				<p>
					The delimiters [] are used to dentote ranges (of integers)
				</p>
				<p>
					[2,6] is the range of integers from 2 to 6 inclusive. It's the set {2,3,4,5,6}.
				</p>	
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h4>Sequence Spaces</h4>				
				<p>The delimiters &lt;&gt; are used to denote sequences.</p>
				<p>
					&lt;A, D, F&gt; is a sequence of three letters.
				</p>
				<p>
					A <dfn>pair</dfn> is a seqence of two. <dfn>X x Y</dfn> is the set of all pairs where the first entry is an element of X,
					and the second entry is an element of Y. X x Y is also called the <dfn>cross product</dfn> of X and Y.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If X is a set then <dfn>X<sup>s</sup></dfn> denotes the set of all sequences whose entries are menbers of X. 	
					It is implility understood that X<sup>s</sup> has the natural operator of concatenation, which is denoted
					with the dot &middot;. Concatenation is an associative operation.
				</p>	
				
				<section>
					<h5>Sequential Maps</h5>
					<p>			
						A map
						<span class="center" style="margin-top:0">m:X<sup>s</sup> &rarr; Y<sup>s</sup></span> 				
						is a <dfn>sequential map</dfn> if it preserves concatenation. That is 
						<span class="center">
							<span class="rule">m(s&middot;t) = m(s)&middot;m(t)</span> 
							<span class="condition">(whenever s, t &in; X<sup>s</sup>)</span>
						</span>
					</p> 
					<section>
						<h6>Sequential Extensions</h6>
						<p style="margin-bottom:0">
							If 
							<span class="center" style="margin-top:0">m:X &rarr; Y<sup>s</sup></span>
							is a map then there is a canonical 	sequential extension
							<span class="center">m<sup>s</sup>:X<sup>s</sup> &rarr; Y<sup>s</sup>, 
							<span class="rule">m<sup>s</sup>(&lt;x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>&gt;) = m(x<sub>1</sub>)&middot;&middot;&middot;m(x<sub>n</sub>)</span>

				<h4>Bit Stream</h4>
				<p>
					A <dfn>bit stream</dfn> is a sequence of bits in computer storage. Commas are not used to separate the entries. Spaces
					may be used for readability
				</p>
				<p>
					The concatentation of the three bit streams 1011, 11001, and 0 is 10 1111 0010. 
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Astral Decomposition &#x1D538; and Virtual Encoding &#x1D54D;</h4>
				<p>Both of these will be defined and used in subsequent sections. They are mentioned now, so they won't be glossed over.</p>
				<p>
					When we get to surrogate math, <dfn> &#x1D538;</dfn> dentotes the canonical <dfn>astral decomposition</dfn> of an astral number
					into a high surrogate and low surrogate pair. Since this map is one-one and onto,  	
					<dfn>&#x1D538;<sup>-1</sup></dfn> is the <dfn>canonical composition</dfn> of a high surrogate, 
					low surrogate pair into an astral number.			
					
				</p>
				<p>
					&#x1D54D; denotes the virtual encoding of a Unicode abtract character to an encoded character.
				</p>
			</section>
				<!-- <p>
					<u>Exapmles</u>:<br><br>OK! You shouldn't have any trouble figuring out the followoing, but do so, since such ideas will be used later.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>					
						If there is a map from a set X to a set Y or a map from X to sequences in Y, then this map canonically extends
						to a map from the sequences in X to sequences in Y. (think concatenation) 
					</li>
					<li>
						If a code unit is defined as a 16 bit stream, then the set of all sequencecs of two code units is canonically equivalent to 
						the set of all 32 bit streams. (think concatenation) 
					</li>
					<li>
						16 bit streams are canonically equivalent to hexidecimal representations with exaclty four hexicecimal digits
						(leading zeros if necessary).
					</li>
				</ol>
				
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Sequences and Ranges</h4>
				<p>The delimiters &lt;&gt; are used to denote sequences, while the delimiters [] are used to dentote ranges (of integers).</p>
				<p>
					&lt;A, D, F&gt; is a sequence of three letters.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A <dfn>pari</dfn> is a sequence of two.
				</p>
			</section>	
			<section>
				<h4>Concatenation</h4>
				<p>
					OK! Everyone knows this, but just in case:
				</p>
				<p>
					Two or more sequences can be concatenated into a single sequence by adjoining the ending and starting endpoints. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The concatenation of the sequences &lt;W, A, B&gt;, &lt;C&gt;, and &lt;B, A, Z, W&gt; is the sequence 
					&lt;W,&nbsp;A,&nbsp;B,&nbsp;C,&nbsp;B,&nbsp;A,&nbsp;Z,&nbsp;W&gt;.

		It's very easy to point out ambigities or lack of well definedness in the descussion of basic semantical and typoographical and unicode terms .
	</p>	
	<p>
		it's very easy to come up with inconsitencies between authors. For example a glyph is precisely a visual representation of a character.
		Also a glyph is precisely a visual rerpresentation of a grapheme. But graphemes and characters are not precisely synononmous. Which means

		This means there is a canonical equivalence between astral numbers and high surrogate numbers/low surrogate number pairs.
	</p>	
	<p>		
		If you are good with binary and hexidecimal numbers you can very quickly come up with the surrogate formulas
		from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#Examples">"Wikipedia UTF-16: Examples"</a>. 
		The following is the long approach since it gives all the simple details.

	<p class="display">
		The quick summary is that given any 20 bit range of numbers and any two 10 bit range of numbers, any number <code>a</code> in the
		20 bit range detrmines a pair of numbers <code>&lt;h,l&gt;</code> where <code>h</code> lies in the first 10 bit range and <code>l</code> lies in the second
		10 bit range. This map is reversible, in that <code>a</code> determines <code>&lt;h,l&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h,l&gt; determines a</code>.
	</p>		
	<p>
		In our particular example, the <dfn>astral numbers</dfn> form the 20 bit range. The <dfn>high surrogates</dfn> 
		and <dfn>low surrogates</dfn> form the two 10 bit ranges.

	<p>
		The <dfn>20 bit numbers</dfn> are all the non-negative integers that can be written with exactly 20 binary bits with possible leading zeros.

		We also need to know that if <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> are the high and low 10 bits of <code>x</code> then they can

	<h2>Unicode Space</h2>	
	<p>
		A unicode <dfn>code point</dfn> is any integer in the range <code>[0, 1114111] = [0x0,0x10FFFF]</code>. The code point
		is usually written in decimal or hexidecimal. Every code point determines a <dfn>unicode number</dfn> obtained by 
		concatenating the abstract unit <code>U</code> with the code point's hexidecimal digits through addition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus the code point <code>193 = 0xC1</code> determines the unicode number <code>U + C1</code>, and the code point of
		<code>U + C1</code> is <code>0xC1 = 193</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The range of unicode space is <code>[U + 0, U + 10FFFF]</code> which corresponds to the range
		<code>[0, 1114111] = [0x0,0x10FFFF]</code> of code points.		
	</p>
	<p class="display">
		Since there is a canonical/trivial one-one correspondence between <i>unicode numbers</i> and (unicode) <i>code points</i>, 
		the notions of <i>unicode number</i> and <i>code point</i> may be conflated without any misunderstanding.
	</p>	
	<p>
		For example, even expert source material will call the unicode number <code>U + FECD</code> a code point.
		Conversely, the code point <code>0xFECD</code> may be referred to as a Unicode number.
	</p>	
	<section>
		<h3>Basic Structure of Unicode Space</h3>
		<p>
			Since code points are numbers, we know what the <dfn>surrogate code points</dfn> are, what the <dfn>high surrogate code points</dfn> are,
			what the <dfn>low surrogate code points</dfn> are, and what the <dfn>astral code points</dfn> are. The non astral code points are the 
			the <dfn>BMP code points</dfn>.

		<p>
			Since the surrogate code point range [U + D800, U + DFFF]  is smack dab in the middle of the BMP code point range
			[U&nbsp;+&nbsp;0000,&nbsp;U&nbsp;+&nbsp;FFFF], there are the left over low BMP and high BMP code points.

		<h3>Unicode Space is a Virtual Encoding Space</h3>
		<p>
			Unicode space is a <dfn>virtual itermediary encoding space</dfn> between abstract characetrs <mark>section???</mark>
			and bytes of computer storage. An abstract character is <dfn>virtually encoded</dfn> as a scalar value or sequence of scalar
			values, which themsevles are <dfn>concretely encoded</dfn> into bytes of computer storage through one of the encoding forms 
			UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 to otain a sequence of bytes that concretely encodes the abstract character in computer storage.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h4>The Unicode Database</h4>
			<p>
				The Unicode Database is the main tool for virtual encodings of abstract characters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Non scalar values (surrogates) are not listed in the database. Not all scalar values are listed in the database. 
				However, if a scalar value is listed in the database with a corresponding abstract character, then the following
				definitions hold.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The abstract character is called a <dfn>Unicode abstract character</dfn>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The scalar value is called an <dfn>encoded character</dfn>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The encoded character is the <dfn>virtual encoding</dfn> of the Unicode abstract character into Unicode space.
					&#x1D54D;:&nbsp;Unicode&nbsp;abstract&nbsp;character&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;encoded&nbsp;character denotes this virtual encoding
					of an abstract character to its encoded character.
					 
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In each record of the database, the first field is the scalar value or encoded character. 
				The second field is the Unicode abstract character (name). If for some reason the second field is 
				not informative then use the eleventh field.

				<h5>Private Use Scalar Values</h5>
				<p>
					Now there are private use scalar values, that a third party can assign an abstract character too. In this case
					the scalar value is also called an <dfn>encoded character</dfn>, and the abstract character will also be called
					a <dfn>Unicode abstract character</dfn>. It's just as if the third party made their own entry into the databasse.					
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left:1em">
					Technically the abstract character is not a Unicode abstract character because it is defined by a third party,
					not the Unicode standard. But let's not quibble because our definition is useful and nothing bad will arise
					as the result. It's important to combine Unicode abstractract characters and private use characters into a single
					concept, However, making another definition to do so is akward and completely unnecessary, at least until I 
					find out otherwise by actually reading the Unicode specification.
				</p>
				
				<p><u>Example</u></p>
				<p style="margin-left:1em">
					0xE000 is a private use scalar value. A third party (or parties) has assinged to it the abstract character VIAMUS CONSORTIUM.
					 So 0xE000 virtually encodes the Unicode abstract character VIAMUS CONSORTIUM.	This
					encoding is recognized by the third parties involed, but no one else.

		<h3>UTF-16 Encoding</h3>
		<div class="display" style="margin-top:1em">
			<p style="margin-top:0">
					UTF-16 encoding is defined as follows
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The UTF-16 encoding of a BMP scalar value is the canonically equivalent code unit, which is
					a 16 bit stream.
				</li>
				<li>
					The UTF-16 encoding of an astral scalar value is obtained by computing its canonical decomposition.
					Then each member of this sequence is replaced by their canonically equivalent
					16 bit stream to obtain a sequence of two code untis. Then these two code units are
					concatenated to obtain a 32 bit binary stream as the encoding of the astral scalar value.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
			It can be deduced that there are no restrictions on a UTF-16 code unit other than that it consists of 16 bits. 
			Thus there is a canonical equivalence between code units and the numbers in the range [0x0000, 0xFFFF], which is the range of BMP 
			code points. Also there is a canonical equivalence between code units and hexidecimal 
			representations with exactly four hexidecimal digits, with possible leading zeros to be implicitly understood.
		</p>		
		<p>
			Through the former canonical equivlannce we know what the <dfn>surrogate code units</dfn> are, and in particular the  
			<dfn>high surrogate code units</dfn> and the <dfn>low surrogate code untis</dfn>. Merely convert the 16 bit code unit to a number. 
			If the number is a surrogate number then the code unit is a surrogate code unit. Likewise for high and low surrogate code units.
		</p>
		<p>			
			Surrogate code units are allowed, and are in fact necessary in UTF-16 encoding. Keep in mind the
			nuanced contrast that UTF-16 does not encode surrogate code points.

			<dl>
				<dt>Abstract Charcter</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						A clear definition of <i>abstract character</i> is hard to obtain because without exception all definitions this author
						has seen, including the one in &sect;3.4, discuss some properties that are expected of abstract characters but without 
						saying what abstract characters actually are. For example, because of the complete lack of specificty in &sect;3.4, a 
						<i>code point</i> meets the criteria for being an <i>abstract character</i>, but it's well known that code points are
						not abstract characters. Let's be more explicit.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are three types of abstract characters.
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Abstract Graphical Character</dt>
						<dd>
							An equivalence class of graphical symbols, especially those that represent characters, or part of characters, in some language
							or system of writing. An element of the equivalence class is a graphic symbol that by common knowleege is understood to represent 
							the abstract character.
							<p><u>Examples</u>:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A is (the name of) an abstract graphical character, for which the
									graphical symbols A, <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">A</span>, and
									<span style="font-family:Algerian">A</span> are all members. The graphical symbol <b>X</b> on the other hand is well 
									understood to be a non member of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A.
								</li>
								<li>
									ACUTE ACCENT is the name of an abstract graphical character for which &#x00B4;, 
									<span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">&#x00B4;</span>
									and <span style="font-family:Algerian">&#x00B4;</span> are all members. While ACUTE ACCENT is used as part of
									characters in some systems of writing, it's sufficient that ACUTE ACCENT is simply an equivalence class of graphical 
									symbols.
								</li>
								<li>
									Company logos are abstract graphical characters, possibly equivalences classes of one, 
									but they are not recognized by Unicode, i.e., lie outside the scope of Unicode.
								</li>
								<!-- any computer-generated character regarded in terms of its shape and bit pattern -->
							</ol>						
						</dd>
						<dt>Abstract Control Character</dt>
						<dd>
							An abstract control character can not be seperated from its use in computer technology. An <dfn>abstract control character</dfn>
							is a universally named identifier that can be used by a prototcol (outside the unicode standard). This protocal will encode 
							the abstract character into a sequence of computer bits to effect some task of controlling textual data. Different
							third parties/protocals may have different ideas for the purpose of any given control character.
							<p>
								A definition specific to Unicode would be that an abstract control character is simply the named identifier of 
								a code point with general category Cc as given in the Unicode database. Again, different third parties/protocals
								are free to intpret thse abstract control characters their own way.
							</p>
							<p>
								In any case, the Unicode idea is that the abstract control character is virtually encoded as a code point, 
								which is then concretley encoded as a sequnece of bits in computer storage through use of 
								UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
							</p>
						</dd>					
						<dt>Abstract Format Character</dt>
						<dd>
							Likewise an abstract format character can not be separated from its use in computer technology. We define
							<dfn>abstract format character</dfn> just like we did abstract control character, except that the purpose 
							of the former is for a specific task of formatting textual data. Third parties/protocals, which conform to 
							Unicode standards are not free to interpret abstract formatting characters their own way.

							That there are direct encodings is such a strong inference that it can be taken as a deduction. Then that
							the second to the last point refers to only direct encodings by the Unicode standard is a strong inference,

						<li>
							The code point 0x00E9 encodes the Unicode abstract character <i>LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE</i>, which

						</li>					
						<li>
							The code point 0x0001 encodes the Unicode abstract character <i>START OF HEADING</i>. The general

				Now while an expert may understand the situation exactly, it's still true that from this section you can't prove what an <i>abstract
				character</i> is, what a <i>Unicode abstract character</i> is, and what an <i>encoded character</i> is. For example, because of the complete lack
				of specificity, a <i>code point</i> meets the criteria	for being an <i>abstract character</i>, but it's well known that 
				code points are not abstract characters. This section makes a very nebulous unclarified distinction between <i>abstract characters</i> and 
				<i>Unicode abstract characters</i>, but uses <i>abstract characters</i> to refer to <i>Unicode abstract characters</i> as if there
				were no difference. The last two points of D7 indicate that threre are direct and indirect unicode encodings of abstract characters.
				However, you can't prove either way whether abstract characters with indirect encodings are Unicode abstract characters.		
				There's no way to prove or disprove whether a given combining character sequence is a Unicode abstract character or not. 
				If there is in fact a distinction between abstract characters and Unicode abstract characters
				then D8 is somewhat useless for Unicode since only sequences of Unicode abstract characters would be of interest.
				At first, an encoded character is defined so that as a side effect it is a code point, but then doubts are raised on whehter
				an encoded character can be a sequence of code points. Etc., etc.

	<h2>Structure of Unicode Space</h2>
	<p>
		A unicode <dfn>code point</dfn> is any integer in the range <code>[0, 1114111] = [0x0,0x10FFFF]</code>. The code point
		is usually written in decimal or hexidecimal. Every code point determines a <dfn>unicode number</dfn> obtained by 
		concatenating the abstract unit <code>U</code> with the code point's hexidecimal digits through addition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus the code point <code>193 = 0xC1</code> determines the unicode number <code>U + C1</code>, and the code point of
		<code>U + C1</code> is <code>0xC1 = 193</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The range of unicode space is <code>[U + 0, U + 10FFFF]</code> which corresponds to the range
		<code>[0, 1114111] = [0x0,0x10FFFF]</code> of code points.		
	</p>
	<p class="display">
		Since there is a trivial one-one correspondence between <i>unicode numbers</i> and (unicode) <i>code points</i>, 
		the notions of <i>unicode number</i> and <i>code point</i> may, and will be, conflated without any misunderstanding.
	</p>	
	<p>
		For example, even expert source material will call the unicode number <code>U + FECD</code> a code point.
		The author will use the terms interchangebly. 
	</p>
	<p class="display">
		Unicode space is a <dfn>virtual itermediary encoding space</dfn> between abstract characetrs (next section) and bytes of computer storage.
		An abstract character is <dfn>virtually encoded</dfn> as a code point or sequence of code points, which themsevles are 
		<dfn>concretely encoded</dfn> into bytes of computer storage through one of the encoding forms UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 to otain a 
		sequence of bytes that concretely encodes the abstract character in computer storage.

				<dt>Abstract Charcter</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						A clear definition of <i>abstract character</i> is hard to obtain because without exception all definitions this author
						has seen, including the one in &sect;3.4, discuss some properties that are expected of abstract characters but without 
						saying what abstract characters actually are. For example, because of the complete lack of specificty in &sect;3.4, a 
						<i>code point</i> meets the criteria for being an <i>abstract character</i>, but it's well known that code points are
						not abstract characters. Let's be more explicit.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are three types of abstract characters.
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>Abstract Graphical Character</dt>
						<dd>
							An equivalence class of graphical symbols, especially those that represent characters, or part of characters, in some language
							or system of writing. An element of the equivalence class is a graphic symbol that by common knowleege is understood to represent 
							the abstract character.
							<p><u>Examples</u>:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A is (the name of) an abstract graphical character, for which the
									graphical symbols A, <span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">A</span>, and
									<span style="font-family:Algerian">A</span> are all members. The graphical symbol <b>X</b> on the other hand is well 
									understood to be a non member of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A.
								</li>
								<li>
									ACUTE ACCENT is the name of an abstract graphical character for which &#x00B4;, 
									<span style="font-family:Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif">&#x00B4;</span>
									and <span style="font-family:Algerian">&#x00B4;</span> are all members. While ACUTE ACCENT is used as part of
									characters in some systems of writing, it's sufficient that ACUTE ACCENT is simply an equivalence class of graphical 
									symbols.
								</li>
								<li>
									Company logos are abstract graphical characters, possibly equivalences classes of one, 
									but they are not recognized by Unicode, i.e., lie outside the scope of Unicode.
								</li>
								<!-- any computer-generated character regarded in terms of its shape and bit pattern -->
							</ol>						
						</dd>
						<dt>Abstract Control Character</dt>
						<dd>
							An abstract control character can not be seperated from its use in computer technology. An <dfn>abstract control character</dfn>
							is a universally named identifier that can be used by a prototcol (outside the unicode standard). This protocal will encode 
							the abstract character into a sequence of computer bits to effect some task of controlling textual data. Different
							third parties/protocals may have different ideas for the purpose of any given control character.
							<p>
								A definition specific to Unicode would be that an abstract control character is simply the named identifier of 
								a code point with general category Cc as given in the Unicode database. Again, different third parties/protocals
								are free to intpret thse abstract control characters their own way.
							</p>
							<p>
								In any case, the Unicode idea is that the abstract control character is virtually encoded as a code point, 
								which is then concretley encoded as a sequnece of bits in computer storage through use of 
								UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32.
							</p>
						</dd>					
						<dt>Abstract Format Character</dt>
						<dd>
							Likewise an abstract format character can not be separated from its use in computer technology. We define
							<dfn>abstract format character</dfn> just like we did abstract control character, except that the purpose 
							of the former is for a specific task of formatting textual data. Third parties/protocals, which conform to 
							Unicode standards are not free to interpret abstract formatting characters their own way.

						<u>Examples from the Unicode Database</u>.
					<ol>
						<li>
							The code point 0x0041 encodes the Unicode abstract character <i>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A</i>, which 
							represents all graphical symbols that are recognzied as a latin captial A. The general category
							of 0x0041 is Lu, and so the Unicode abstract character is an upper case letter. The graphical
							symbol <b>X</b> is well understood to be a non member of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A.
						</li>
						<li>
							The code point 0x00E9 encodes the Unicode abstract character <i>LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE</i>, which
							represents all graphical symbols that are recognized as the small ltter e with an acute
							symbol on top. The general category of 0x00E9 is Ll, and so the Unicode abstract character is
							a lower case letter.
						</li>					
						<li>
							The code point 0x0001 encodes the Unicode abstract character <i>START OF HEADING</i>. The general 
							category of 0x0001 is Cc. So the Unicode abstract character is a control character and the code 
							point is used by some software to control textual data.
						</li>				
						<li>
							The code point 0x0300 encodes the Unicodee abstract character <i>COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT</i>. The general
							category of 0x0300 is Mn and so the Unicode abstract charater is a nonspacing mark, in this case a 
							diacritical mark.

						The definition given in &sect;3.4 does't require the abstract characters to be Unicode absstract characters

						More simply, the designated code points are all code points except for the reserved code points. 
					</p> 
				</dd>
				<dt>Private Use Code Points</dt>			
				<dd>
					Code points in the private use area will never be assigned abstract characters by the Unicode Consortium. 
					Code points in the private use area may be assinged abstract characters by other parties while maintaing conformity 
					to the Unicode standards. Their usage may be shared amongst any number of parties. Different sets of parties

				</dd>
				<dt>Non Characters</dt>
				<dd>
					Like private use code points, non characters will never be assigned abstract characters by the Unicode Consortium.
					That's the job of a single party for internal use, not to be shared with other parties. But whose going to stop

					</p>
				<p>
					After awhile I made the following observations.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Non characters and reserved code points, all of which have general category Cn, are never listed in the data base. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Surrogate code points, all of which have general category Cs, are never listed in the database.
					</li>
					<li>
						 Code points, which belong to other categories, are all  listed in the data base.
						 <ul>
						 	<li>
								Even private use characters, all of which have general category is Co, are all listed in the data base.	 	
						 	</li>
						 </ul>
						 <p>
							As later shown, we know exactly what the non characetrs are and exactly what the susrrogate code points are. 
							This means all other code points not listed in the data base are reserved code points.	
							So the data base is parsed to find all reserved code points. The results are listed

				Now while an expert may understand the situation exactly, it's still true that from this section you can't prove what an <i>abstract
				character</i> is, what a <i>Unicode abstract character</i> is, and what an <i>encoded character</i> is. For example, because of the complete lack
				of specificity, a <i>code point</i> meets the criteria	for being an <i>abstract character</i>, but it's well known that 
				code points are not abstract characters. This section makes a very nebulous unclarified distinction between <i>abstract characters</i> and 
				<i>Unicode abstract characters</i>, but uses <i>abstract characters</i> to refer to <i>Unicode abstract characters</i> as if there
				were no difference. The last two points of D7 indicate that threre are direct and indirect unicode encodings of abstract characters.
				However, you can't prove either way whether abstract characters with indirect encodings are Unicode abstract characters.		
				There's no way to prove or disprove whether a given combining character sequence is a Unicode abstract character or not. 
				If there is in fact a distinction between abstract characters and Unicode abstract characters
				then D8 is somewhat useless for Unicode since only sequences of Unicode abstract characters would be of interest.
				At first, an encoded character is defined so that as a side effect it is a code point, but then doubts are raised on whehter
				an encoded character can be a sequence of code points. Etc., etc.

				Stand alone surrogates are ill formed. Given a string of UTF-16 codeponts, the ill formed <dfn>stand alone surrogates</dfn>

				<p>
					If an UTF-16 Unicod string is specified as being well formed then it is highly illegal/non coformant for the string
					to be ill formed, of course because that would be an outright lie. If the UTF-16 string is not specified as being well 
					formed, then it is not illegal for it to be ill foremd. In fact it is expected that the string might be ill formed.
					For example, strings in Java, C#, or ECMAScript are Unicode 16-bit strings, but are not necessarily well-formed UTF-16
					sequences.

			JavaScript encodes Unicode numbers at the language level. Like the UTF-16 machine encodings, a Unicode number still maps 
			to a sequence of one or two code units. But at the language level, the meaning of code unit must change. 
			A <dfn>code unit</dfn> refers to a 16 bit logical value of text. Read on.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now even though UTF-8 is most commonly used and is the recommended machine encoding, it's ironic that only UTF-16 
			corresponds extremely well with JavaScript language encodings. You can directly use big endian UTF-16 encodings in 
			JavaScript. The UTF-16 encoding of certain Unicode numbers into surrogate pairs translates directly into JavaScript.	
			See <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16" style="white-space:pre">Wikipedia: UTF-16</a>, 
			which you probably should read.
		</p>		
		<p>
			So simple facts about UTF-16 encoding can be used as ratinoliaztions for JavaScript language encodings, 
			even if UTF-8 or UTF-32 machine encodings are used. Further definitive evidence follows.

			</p>
			<ol>

					<code>'\u223C'</code> is a JavaScript encoding of <code>U + 223C</code>. If you count the number of logical

				</li>
				<li>
					Like wise <code>'\x0F'</code> which can be

					<code>'\u{1D566}'</code> counts as 20 logical bits, whence <code>'\u{1D566}'</code> is not a JavaScript character.

		<mark>What about some of these space characters having no effect</mark>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that there are some double negations, e.g., <code>0x9</code> (horizontal tab) is encodable
			by HTML. A very good question is why some white spaces such as the vertical tab may be written in HTML,
			but has no effect on the display of HTML -- it's exactly like the vertical tab is not written at all.
			The experts need to explain that.			
		</p>					
		<p>
			<code>0x0</code> and <code>0xD</code> are not individually listed as excluded because they lie in the range
			<code>[0x0, 0x19]</code> of C0 control points. According to UnicodeData.txt <code>0x7F</code> is a control character. 
			Also the space character <code>0x20</code> is not a control character. So the space character is not excluded, and 
			is allowed in HTML. For those that do consider <code>0x20</code> as a control character, 
			its excluded anyway. The same discussion holds for <code>0x0A</code>, the non breaking space character.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I first saw C1 control points being displayed as other characters, it was very perplexing. However,
			Mouzer found the following reference as explanation.				
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_latin1_supplement.asp">W3 Schools: C1 Controls</a>	
			(Scroll down to C1 Controls).	
		</p>	
		<p>
			We already knew what the surrogates and non characters are. Now we know what the control characters other
			than the space characters are. There is now have enough informaton to allow our HTML editor to vaildate HTML 
			characters if you're the person who is into that type of thing.

		<h3>Named HTML Entities</h3>
		<p>There are hundreds of HTML entities that are deemed worthy enough to be given alphabetic names. See  		
			<a target="_blank" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#named-character-references">W3: Named Character References</a>
			The names listed in the first column of the table must be prefixed with the amepersand character <code>&amp;</code> to obtain 
			the corresponding HTML entity.
		</p>	
		<p>
			The sole purpse of the named entity <code>&amp;AElig;</code> is to produce the glyph
			<code>&AElig;</code>. The follwoing example shows how to obtain the decimal and hexidecimal 
			character codes of <code>&amp;AElig;</code>.		
		</p>	
<div style="white-space:pre;background-color:rgb(255,220,220);padding-left:-2em"> 
	&lt;div id="test"&gt;&amp;AElig;&lt;/div&gt;
						
	&lt;script&gt;
					
		var <dfn>decimalCharCode</dfn> = document.getElementById('test').innerHTML.codePointAt(0);
		var <dfn>hexidecimalCharCode</dfn> = decimalCharCode.toString(16);
								
		alert("decimalCharCode = " + decimalCharCode + "\nhexidecimalCharCode  = " + hexidecimalCharCode ); 
		//alerts <dfn>decimalCharCode = 198</dfn> and <dfn>hexidecimalCharCode = c6</dfn> 
							
	&lt;/script&gt;
</div>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Thus the the decimal and hexidecimal character codes of <code>&amp;AElig;</code> are <code>198 = 0xC6</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
				The corresponding decimal and hexidecimal entities are <code>&amp;#198; = &amp;xC6;</code>.
			</li>				
			<li>
				The corresponding JavaScript hexidecimal and symbolic characters are
				<code style="white-space:pre">'\xC6' = '\u00C6' = '&Aacute;'</code>. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>&amp;AElig;</code> may be referenced by the Unicode number <code>U + 00C6</code>. 
				<code>&amp;AElig; = &amp;#198 = &amp;xC6; = &AElig;</code> can be used as HTML markup.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Compound Named HTML Entities</h3>
		<p style="margin-bottom:0">
			There are named HTML entities that combine exactly two (currently never more than two) Unicode numbers. For example the named
			HTML entity <code>&amp;nvrtrie;</code> produces the web symbol 				
		</p>
		<code class="centerTable">&nvrtrie;</code>
		<p style="margin-top:1em">
			This web symbol is the concactenation of the glyph <code>&#x22B5;</code> associated with the Unicode number <code>U + 22B5</code>,
			with the glyph&ensp; <code>&#x20D3;</code> &ensp; associated with the Unicode number <code>U + 20D3</code>. Thus the named entity
			<code>&amp;nvrtrie;</code> corresonds to the ordered pair <code style="white-space:pre">(U + 22B5, U + 20D3)</code> of Unicode numbers.
			One can also obtain the web symbol in unnamed fashion as <code>&amp;#x22B5;&amp;#x20D3;</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			No JavaScript character corresponds to <code>&amp;nvtire;</code>, but there is a corresponding JavaScript string, namely
			<code style="white-space:pre">'\u22B5\20D3'</code>. 
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2em">
			Writing <code>&amp;#x22B5;&amp;#x20D3;</code> in HTML is the same as writing 
			<code>&amp;#x22B5;</code> and <code>&amp;#x20D3;</code> back to back, which is the same as writing the JavaScript characters
			<code>'\u22B5'</code> and <code>'\20D3'</code> to HTML back to back, which is the same as writing the string
			<code>'\u22B5\20D3'</code> to HTML.
		</p>
		<p>
			Again, observe how <code>'\u22B5\20D3'</code> is formatted in excactly the same manner as the characters associated with
			surrogate pairs. <mark>OK make sure disusions are extant; Read table -two unicode numbers: JavaScript surrogate encodings</mark>
			<br>
			<mark>mae sure have examples of two code ponts from the table: use the first one</mark>

		<h3>Don't use Surrogates to write to HTML</h3>
		<p>
			In writing HTML or JavaScript, computeantion of surrogates is completely unnecessary.
			Take the code point <code>0x10437</code> which lies in the range of code points that can be decomposed  into
			two surrages, in this case <code>0xD801</code> and <code>0xDC37</code>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One can use <code>&amp;#x10437;</code> as is to produce the glyph <code>&#x10437;</code>, surrogates not needed. 
			Now, while one can use the surrogate pair to obtain the corresponding JavaScript character <code>'\uD801\uDC37'</code>
			(this counts as a single character), doing so simply represents a waste of time in computing surrogates since one 
			can just use <code>'\u{10437}'</code> as the corresponding JavaScript character.

		<h3>Use Surrogate Pairs in Reading and Writing back to HTML</h3>
		<p>
			Suppose we want to read characters from HTML and write them back (somewhere else).
			Some characters are really read back as two code points in the ranges 
			<code>[55296, 56319]</code> and <code>[56320, 57343]</code>, each of which alone is completely useless. 
			These two code points will be surrogate pairs. So for example if the two surrogate pairs are
			the code points <code>55378</code> and <code>57186</code> they must be combined, throgh combineSurrogates, 
			to produce the single code point <code>66615</code>. Then one can use <code>&amp;#6615;</code> to write to back
			the original character to HTML. 			  
		</p>
		<p>
			Now if you want the corresponding JavaScript character, it's just <code>String.fromCodePoint(66615);</code>
		</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2em">
			Conversions to hexidcimal are more work. Since <code>66615 = 0x10437</code> the corresponding JavasCript 
			character is <code>'\u{10437}'</code>. Also <code>55378 = 0xD852</code> and  <code>57186 = 0xDF62</code>, so the 
			corresponding JavaScript character is also <code style="white-space:pre">'\uD852\uDF62'</code>.

	<!--
	<p>
		Thes surrogte encoding is completely unnecesarary since one can just use the entity <code>&amp;#x10437;</code> as is to 
		produce the glyph <code>&#x10437;</code>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, while one can use the surrogate pair to obtain the corresponding JavaScript character <code>'\uD801\uDC37'</code>, 
		doing so simply represents a waste of time in computing surrogates since one can just use <code>'\u{10437}'</code>

	<p>
		Alluding to what was mentioned earlier, <code>'\uD801\uDC37'</code> has exactly the same format as JavaScript strings corresponding to 
		compound named entities. Hoever, there is no relationship between surrogate pairs, or the Unicode numbers they represent,
		and compound named entities.

		There is one exception. If the symbol for the non breaking space entity 
		<code>&amp;nbsp; = &amp;#38; = &amp;#x26;</code> is copied and then pasted into the editor, it is pasted as a 
		normal space <code>&amp;#32; = &amp;#20;</code>, and so will be displayed in the web page as a normal space and not a 
		non breaking space.

	<p>	
		Web symbols in the editor can be shown in miniscule fonts, so one may not want to adopt the pasting technique.

		Symbol cells with red coloring indicate that the corresponding HTML entities are the only way to produce the web symbol

	<p>
		If the HTML entity does not have a web symbol, the symbol cell is left blank and there is no symbolic character. 		
	</p>
	<p>
		The non breaking space <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> entity has a web symbol, but no symbolic character.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This is an introduction to <code>HTML entities</code> for beginners. All necessary details are covered. The author simply 
		couldn't find a single treatixe that didn't leave major details out, and the beginner behind. 
		At a sligthly more advanced level, this article provides the background for writing an HTML editor in HTML/JavaScript.

	<h2>HTML Named Entities </h2>
	<p>
		With only six exceptions, all HTML named entities have JavaScript human readable symbolic characters. 
		Merely put the page symbol in quotes. The six exceptions follow.
	</p>	
	<ol style="-webkit-columns: 100px 3;-moz-columns: 100px 3;columns: 100px 3;list-style:lower-roman">
		<li style="margin-top:0"><code>&amp;nbsp;</code></li>
		<li><code>&amp;lrm;</code></li>
		<li><code>&amp;rlm;</code></li>
		<li><code>&amp;shy;</code></li>
		<li><code>&amp;zwj;</code></li>
		<li><code>&amp;zwnj;</code></li>		
	</ol>

	<!-- 
	<ol>
		<li>
			The first table columns lists all <dfn>named entities</dfn> together with their equivalent <dfn>decimal entitities</dfn>. 
			These are written in the HTML editor to display, on the web page, the page symbol shown in the third column.	
			
		</li>
		<li>
			Equivalent JavaScript <dfn>character codes</dfn> are given in the second column. The numeric character codes always refers to 
			the hexidecimal form of the decimal entity. Both <code>u</code> and <code>x</code> stand for hexidecimal, but 
			their semantic use differs. <code>x</code> must be used with exactly two hexidecmial digits, with a possible leading zero. 
			<code>u</code> must be used with exactly four hexidecimal digits with possible leading zeros.
			<ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
				<li>			
				For example, the HTML decimal entity <code>&amp;#32;</code> corresponds to the JavaScript character code <code>'\x20'</code>.
				</li>		
				<li>
					For example, <code>'\x2E'</code> and <code>'\u002E'</code> are identical JavaScript hexidecimal character codes.
				</li>				
				<li>
					A pertinent example, that you might run acrosss, is that the Unicode character <code>U + 2227</code> refers 
					to <code>'\u2227'</code>.	Both <code>U</code> and <code>u</code> stand for Unicode, but numerics of Unicode are always hexidecimal.
				</li>				
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			All hexidecimal JavaScript character codes have equvalent human readable symbolic character codes. Merely put the page symbol in quotes.
			In the tables, there is only one exception to this rule. The non breaking space <code>&amp;nbsp; = &amp;#38;</code> has numeric character
			code <code>'\x26'</code>, but has no symbolic character code.
			<ol style="list-style:lower-latin">
				<li>
					To obtain the page symobl, merely copy it from the table. If you paste it into the HTML editor in HTML code,
					the symbol will render on the web page as is. If you paste it inside quotes inside JavaScript code, the
					symbolic code is obtained. Mirosoft editors allow all of this. However, most likely, some editors will not allow 
					the pasting, in which case you are stuck with the non human readable forms.
				</li>
			</ol>

	<h2>Named Entity Tables</h2> <mark>REWRITE</mark>
	<p>
		There is a high degree of duplicty in most rows of the tables. Like whatever! Meouzer don't care! Meouzer don't give a schmuck!!
		Besides for beginners, this is a good thing. There are nine anomalies, inidcated by red coloriong, to normal rules that the otherwise 
		duplicitous format of the tables give. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Any of the three equivalent forms of an <dfn>HTML entity</dfn>, in the first column, is written in the HTML editor to display the Web page symbol
		shown in the third column. If there is an editor symbol it displays the same web symbol (itself). To obtain the editor page symbol, merely copy 
		the web page symbol from the table and past it into the editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the web page symbol or editor symbol is some type of space, its cell is colored aqua. Double click on the cell to see the displayed
		space.

				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<code>'\x0A' = = 'u000A' = '\n'</code> (new line obtained by striking the enter key)

					</li>
					<li>
						<code>'\x20' = '\u0020'</code> (normal space character obtained by striking the space bar)
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				are white spaces that show up in the editor and in the outerHTML of any containing HTMLElement. They
				are not condensed in the editor or outerHTMLs. They are condensed only in the display of the
				web page.
						
				<p> There is one exception. 
					White space occurring inside a tag may or may not show up in the outerHTML depending upon the browser.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Thus one may parse an HTMLElement's outer HTML and write new HTML by substituting different characters
					for these white spaces. This is an important key in the author's JSHTML, which is bacically an editor
					for displaying JavaScript in HTML. 
				</p>				
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Entities that show up as white spaces in outerHTML</h3>			
			<p>
				Writing the En space <code>&amp;ensp;</code> entity in the editor shows up as the character <code>'\x2002'</code>
				in outerHTML, which is displayed as a space. Likwise copy and pastiong the En space web symbol into the 
				editor has the same effect. The same discussion holds for the for the Em space <code>&amp;emsp; = '\x2003'</code> 
				and the thin space <code>&amp;thinsp; = '\u2009'</code>. 
			</p>						
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h3>Escaped Characters</h3>		
	
			<p>
				The <code>&lt;</code> symbol inside the editor is reserved for the start of tags. If you used this character outside this scenario,
				parsing the HTML, even if possible, would be a nightmare to determine whether  <code>&lt;</code> stands for a start tag or the less than symbol.
				Thus if not used as the start of a tag, the less than symbol must be escaped. <code>&amp;lt;</code> is used for this
				purpose and produces the less than symbol on the web page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like wise in the editor the <code>&gt;</code> symbol is used to terminate tagd and so must be escaped 
				as <code>&amp;gt;</code> to produce the greater than symbol on the web page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since the <code>&amp;</code> character is used in the editor for writing HTML entities such as <code>&amp;Aacute;</code>,
				parsing is possible but very inefficient to also use <code>&amp;</code> to display <code>&amp;</code> on the web page.
				Thus <code>&amp;</code> is escaped as <code>&amp;amp;</code> to efficiently display <code>&amp;</code> on the web page.
			</p>
		</section>	
		
		<section>
			<h3>Two Way Editor</h3>		
			<p>
				The author has a <dfn>two way HTML Editor</dfn> written in HTML/JavaScript (A one way editor is simpler). 
				A content editable pre element is used as the
				HTML editor, while an content editable div is used as the "web page". Changes to the source HTML in the pre
				are updated to the div web page. Conversely changes to the div web page are updated to the pre HTML editor.
				Since En, Em and thin spaces pasted into the the web page can display as white space characters
				in the editor, when the web page is parsed to obtain editor code, HTML entities can be substituted for the white spaces.
				This means readabiltiy, for otherwise there's no way to know how the spaces were obtained. 	
			</p>	
			<p>
				Believe it or not, we now know everything to write HTML editors in HTML.

code units in the UTF-16 character encoding form. They are unassigned to any
abstract character.
C2    A process shall not interpret a noncharacter code point as an abstract character.
•   The noncharacter code points may be used internally, such as for sentinel val-
ues or delimiters, but should not be exchanged publicly.
C3    A process shall not interpret an unassign

•   This  clause  does  not  preclude  the  assi
gnment  of  certain  generic  semantics  to
unassigned  code  points  (for  example,  rendering  with  a  glyph  to  indicate  the
position within a character block) that allow for graceful behavior in the pres-
ence of code points that are outside a supported subset.
•   Unassigned code points may have default property values. (See D26.)
•   Code points whose use has not yet been designated may be assigned to abstract
characters in future versions of the standard. Because of this fact, due care in
the handling of generic semantics for such code points is likely to provide better
robustness for implementations that may encounter data based on future ver-

C5    A process shall not assume that it is requir
ed to interpret any particular coded character
sequence.
•   Processes that interpret only a subset of Unicode characters are allowed; there is
no blanket requirement to interpret

Conformance Requirements 
•   Although these clauses are not intended to preclude enumerations or specifica-
tions of the characters that a process or sy
stem is able to interpret, they do sep-
arate  supported  subset  enumerations  from  the  question  of  conformance.  In
actuality, any system may occasionally receive an unfamiliar character code that
it is unable to interpret.
C6    A process shall not assume that the interpretations of two canonical-equivalent charac-
ter sequences are distinct.
•   The  implications  of  this  conformance  clause  are  twofold.  First,  a  process  is
never required to give different interpretations to two different, but canonical-
equivalent  character  sequences.  Second,  no  process  can  assume  that  another
process will make a distinction between two different, but canonical-equivalent
character sequences.
•   Ideally,  an  implementation  would  always  interpret  two  canonical-equivalent
character sequences identically. There 
are practical circumstances under which
implementations may reasonably distinguish them.
•   Even processes that normally do not distinguish between canonical-equivalent
character sequences can have reasonable exception behavior. Some examples of
this  behavior  include  graceful  fallback  processing  by  processes  unable  to  sup-
port correct positioning of nonspacing marks; “Show Hidden Text” modes that
reveal  memory  representation  structure;  and  the  choice  of  ignoring  collating
behavior of combining character sequences that are not part of the repertoire of
a   specified   language   (see   
Section 5.12,   Strategies   
for   Handling   Nonspacing
Marks

Modification
C7    When  a  process  purports  not  to  modify  the  interpretation  of  a  valid  coded  character
sequence, it shall make no change to that 
coded character sequence other than the possi-
ble replacement of character sequences by their canonical-equivalent sequences. 
•   Replacement  of  a  character  sequence  by  a  compatibility-equivalent  sequence
does
 modify the interpretation of the text.
•   Replacement  or  deletion  of  a  character  sequence  that  the  process  cannot  or
does not interpret 
does
 modify the interpretation of the text.
•   Changing the bit or byte ordering of a character sequence when transforming it
between different machine architectures 
does not modify the interpretation of
the text.
•   Changing a valid coded character sequence from one Unicode character encod-
ing form to another does not modify the interpretation of the text.
Conformance

Conformance Requirements 
•   Changing  the  byte  serialization  of  a  code  unit  sequence  from  one  Unicode
character  encoding  scheme  to  another  does  not  modify  the  interpretation  of
the text.
•   If  a  noncharacter  that  does  not  have  a  specific  internal  use  is  unexpectedly
encountered  in  processing,  an  implementation  may  signal  an  error  or  replace
the noncharacter with U+FFFD 
replacement character
. If the implementa-
tion chooses to replace, delete or ignore a noncharacter, such an action consti-
tutes a modification in the interpretation of the text. In general, a noncharacter
should  be  treated  as  an  unassigned  code  point.  For  example,  an  API  that
returned a character property value for a noncharacter would return the same
value as the default value for an unassigned code point.
•   Note that security problems can result 
if noncharacter code points are removed
from text received from external sources. For more information, see
Section 23.7, Noncharacters
, and Unicode Technical Report #36, “Unicode Secu-
rity Considerations.”
•   All processes and higher-level protocols are required to abide by conformance
clause  C7  at  a  minimum.  However,  higher-level  protocols  may  define  addi-
tional  equivalences  that  do  not  consti
tute  modifications  under  that  protocol.
For  example,  a  higher-level  protocol  may  allow  a  sequence  of  spaces  to  be
replaced by a single space.

Conformance Requirements 
C10    When a process interprets a code unit sequence which purports to be in a Unicode char-
acter encoding form, it shall treat ill-formed
 code unit sequences as an error condition
and shall not interpret such sequences as characters.
•   For example, in UTF-8 every code unit of the form 110xxxx
2
must
 be followed
by a code unit of the form 10xxxxxx
2
. A sequence such as 110xxxxx
2
 0xxxxxxx
2
is  ill-formed  and  must  never  be  genera
ted.  When  faced  with  this  ill-formed
code unit sequence while transforming or interpreting text, a conformant pro-
cess must treat the first code unit 110xxxxx
2
 as an illegally terminated code unit
sequence—for  example,  by  signaling  an  error,  filtering  the  code  unit  out,  or
representing  the  code  unit  with  a  marker  such  as  U+FFFD  
replacement
character
.
•   Conformant processes cannot interpret ill-formed code unit sequences. How-
ever, the conformance clauses do not prevent processes from operating on code
unit sequences that do not purport to be in a Unicode character encoding form.
For example, for performance reasons a low-level string operation may simply
operate  directly  on  code  units,  without  interpreting  them  as  characters.  See,
especially, the discussion under D89.
•   Utility  programs  are  not  prevented  from  operating  on  “mangled”  text.  For
example, a UTF-8 file could have had CRLF sequences introduced at every 80
bytes by a bad mailer program. This could result in some UTF-8 byte sequences
being  interrupted  by  CRLFs,  producing  illegal  byte  sequences.  This  mangled
text is no longer UTF-8. It is permi
ssible  for  a  conformant  program  to  repair
such text, recognizing that the mangled text was originally well-formed UTF-8
byte  sequences.  However,  such  repair  of  mangled  data  is  a  special  case,  and  it
must  not  be  used  in  circumstances  where  it  would  cause  security  problems.
There are important security issues associated with encoding conversion, espe-
cially  with  the  conversion  of  malforme
d  text.  For  more  information,  see  Uni-

ordering
  in  terms  of  whether  the  most  signifi-
cant byte or the least significant byte comes first. These sequences are known as
“big-endian” and “little-en

Characters and Encoding 
•   While  an  encoded  character  is  form
ally  defined  in  terms  of  the  mapping
between an abstract character and a code point, informally it can be thought of
as an abstract character taken together with its assigned code point.
•   Occasionally, for compatibility with other standards, a single abstract character
may correspond to more than one code point—for example, “Å” corresponds
both to U+00C5 Å 
latin capital letter a with ring above 
and to U+212B
Å 
angstrom sign

represented
  by  a  sequence  of  code
points—for example, 
latin capital letter g with acute
 may be represented by the
sequence  <U+0047  
latin  capital  letter  g
,  U+0301  
combining  acute
accent
>, rather than being mapped to a single code point.
D12    Coded character sequence:
 An ordered sequence of one or more code points. 
•   A coded character sequence
is also known as a 
coded character representation
.
•   Normally a coded character sequence consists of a sequence of encoded charac-
ters, but it may also include noncha
racters or reserved code points.
•   Internally, a process may choose to make 
use of noncharacter code points in its
coded  character  sequences.  However,  such  noncharacter  code  points  may  not
be  interpreted  as  abstract  characters  (see  conformance  clause  C2).  Their
removal by a conformant process constitu
tes modification of interpretation of
the coded character sequence (see conformance clause C7).
•   Reserved  code  points  are  included  in  coded  character  sequences,  so  that  the
conformance   requirements   regarding   interpretation   and   modification   are
properly  defined  when  a  Unicode-conformant  implementation  encounters
coded character sequences produced under a future version of the standard.
Unless specified otherwise for clarity, in the text of the Unicode Standard the term 
character
alone
designates an encoded character. Similarly, the term 
character sequence
 alone desig-
nates a coded character sequence.
D13    Deprecated character:
 A coded character whose use is strongly discouraged. 
•   Deprecated characters are retained in the standard indefinitely, but should not
be used. They are retained in the standard so that previously conforming data
stay conformant in future versions of the standard.
•   Deprecated  characters  typically  consist  of  characters  with  significant  architec-
tural problems, or ones which cause implementation problems. Some examples
of   characters   deprecated   on   these   grounds   include   tag   characters   (see
Section 23.9,  Deprecated  Tag  Characters
)  and  the  alternate  format  characters
(see 
Section 23.3, Deprecated Format Characters
).
•   Deprecated characters are explicitly indicated in the Unicode code charts. They
are  also  given  an  explicit  property  value  of  Deprecated=True  in  the  Unicode
Character Database.
Conformance
92
3.4
Characters and Encoding 
•   Deprecated characters should not be confused with obsolete characters, which
are  historical.  Obsolete  characters  do  not  occur  in  modern  text,  but  they  are
not deprecated; their use is not discouraged.
D14    Noncharacter:
 A code point that is permanently reserved for internal use. Nonchar-
acters consist of the values U+
n
FFFE and U+
n
FFFF (where 
n
 is from 0 to 10
16
) and
the values U+FDD0..U+FDEF.
•   For more information, see 
Section 23.7, Noncharacters
.
•   These code points are permanently reserved as noncharacters.
D15    Reserved  code  point:
  Any  code  point  of  the  Unicode  Standard  that  is  reserved  for
future assignment. Also known as an 
unassigned code point
.
•   Surrogate code points and noncharacters are considered assigned code points,
but not assigned characters.
•   For  a  summary  classification  of  reserved  and  other  types  of  code  points,  see
Ta b l e 2 - 3
.
In general, a conforming process may indicate the presence of a code point whose use has
not been designated (for example, by showing 
a missing glyph in rendering or by signaling
an appropriate error in a streaming protocol), even though it is forbidden by the standard
from 
interpreting
 that code point as an abstract character.
D16    Higher-level  protocol:
  Any  agreement  on  the  interpretation  of  Unicode  characters
that extends beyond the scope of this standard.
•   Such an agreement need not be formally announced in data; it may be implicit
in the context.
•   The  specification  of  some  Unicode  algorithms  may  limit  the  scope  of  what  a
conformant higher-level protocol may do.
D17    Unicode  algorithm:
  The  logical  description  of  a  process  used  to  achieve  a  specified
result involving Unicode characters.
•   This definition, as used in the Unicode 
Standard and other publications of the
Unicode  Consortium,  is  intentionally  broad  so  as  to  allow  precise  logical
description  of  required  results,  without  constraining  implementations  to  fol-
low the precise steps of that logical description.
D18    Named  Unicode  algorithm:
  A  Unicode  algorithm  that  is  specified  in  the  Unicode
Standard  or  in  other  standards  published  by  the  Unicode  Consortium  and  that  is
given an explicit name for ease of reference.
•   Named Unicode algorithms are cited in
 titlecase in the Unicode Standard.
Ta b l e  3 - 1
 lists the named Unicode algorithms and in
dicates the locations of their specifica-
tions. Details regarding conformance to these algorithms and any restrictions they place on
the scope of allowable tailoring by higher-level
 protocols can be found in the specifications.
Conformance
93
3.4
Characters and Encoding 
In some cases, a named Unicode algorithm is provided for information only. When exter-
nally referenced, a named Unicode algorithm may be prefixed with the qualifier “Unicode”
to make the connection of the algorithm to the Unicode Standard and other Unicode spec-
ifications clear. Thus, for example, the Bidirect
ional Algorithm is generally referred to by its
full name, “Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.” As much as is practical, the titles of Unicode
Standard  Annexes  which  define  Unicode  algorithms  consist  of  the  name  of  the  Unicode
algorithm they specify. In a few cases, named Unicode algorithms are also widely known by
their acronyms, and those acronyms are also listed in 
Ta b l e 3 - 1

		I'ts fun and easy to exchange secret messages with your friends using your new UTF-8 decoder rings. Hiding
		important activiities parents has never been simpler. All you need is a PhD in mathematics, which 
		as item #UTF8-LQeX is sold in four easy payments of $30.00 per month.

	<p>
		<code>M<sub>[a,b]</sub></code> is the mask consisting of <code>(b - a + 1)</code> binary digits in positions <code>a to b</code>.
		<code>a</code> will start at 1, not 0.		
	</p>
	<p class="display centerTable" style="text-align:center">
		<code>M<sub>[a,b]</sub> = M<sub>[1, 1+b-a]</sub> &sdot; 2<sup>a-1</sup> = (2<sup>1+b-a</sup> -1) &sdot; 2<sup>a-1</sup></code>
	</p>
		Given a non negative integer <code>c</code> if we move some its hghter bits to the left, and possibly some even higher bits to the 
		left so that there is no overlap we get a number <code>e</code>, and there will be a formula mapping <code>e</code> back to <code>c</code>. 
		This actually easy. An example follows.
	<p style="text-align:center" >
		<code>c &rarr; e <br>   e = c &amp; M<sub>&thinsp;[0,5]</sub>  + ((c &amp; M<sub>&thinsp;[6,10]</sub>)&ensp;&lt;&lt; 3)<br>
		<br> has inverse map<br><br>
		c &larr; e<br>
		c = e &amp; M<sub>&thinsp;[0,5]</sub> + ((e &amp; M<sub>&thinsp;[9,13]</sub>) &gt;&gt;&ensp; 3)</code>		
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>e</code> is an encoding of <code>c</code>. Now <code>c</code> and <code>e</code> determine each othe by the inverse formulas.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we are going to encode numbers <code>c</code> in the range [0x0, 0x10FFFF] via the UTF-8 encoding form to  numbers <code>e</code>.

In Unicode, "Control-characters" are U+0000—U+001F (C0 controls), U+007F (delete), and U+0080—U+009F (C1 controls). 
Their General Category is "Cc". Formatting codes are distinct, in General Category "Cf". The Cc control characters have no Name in Unicode. 
They may be indicated informally as "<control-001A>".[2]

position within a character block) that allow for graceful behavior in the pres-
ence of code points that are outside a supported subset.
•   Unassigned code points may have default property values. (See D26.)
•   Code points whose use has not yet been designated may be assigned to abstract
characters in future versions of the standard. Because of this fact, due care in
the handling of generic semantics for such code points is likely to provide better
robustness for implementations that may encounter data based on future ver-
sions of the standard
