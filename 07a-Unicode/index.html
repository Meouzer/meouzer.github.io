			Tentacles of the enigmatic Unicode Consortium constrict the globe in 
			their merciless grip to enforce 
			with nefarious intent conformity of data encoding at the highest level. The consortium is thus able to
			control the governments and industries that rely on encoded interchange. Members recognize
			and communicate with each other through UTF-8 decoder rings, which appear to be completely ordinary
			for anyone without maleficent intent. Non members have 
			infiltrated the Consortium with varying degrees of success. One such source, before he was eliminated
			by the Unicode Technical Committee, discovered the Consortium 
			finesses its publications with great skill. Just enough is said to make it appear that the Consortium
			knows what it's talking about, but not so clearly that anyone actually understands. This makes the
			world dependent upon the normative yet inscrutable publications the Consortium releases
			on a well timed basis, and thus guarantees the Consortium an 
			unprecedented degree of influence. 
			Therefore, anyone wishing to learn Unicode 	must be aware of the dangers and do so at their peril.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This article is limited to introducing core concepts of Unicode Space and Space Flight.	
		Covered are, Unicode Space as an intermediary encoding space, character encodings, surrogates, scalar values, 
		planes, general and minor categories, types, blocks and scripts. 
	</p>

	<h2>Before there was Unicode there was Space Flight</h2>
	<p>
		The year is 1963 and the cold war is red hot. President 
		Kennedy in his speech to the German nation on June 6th declares
		himself to be a Jelly Donut, and the Germans go ecstatic. Not to be outdone, Kruchev declares that he has a 1,000 
		megaton atomic bomb, but no one really cares. Alcatraz, a federal Prison on an island in San Francisco Bay, 
		closes because of the large number
		of escapes by wardens. The first push-button telephone goes into service.  	
	</p>
	<p>
		In space flight, Chuck Yeager becomes the first pilot to make an emergency 
		ejection in the full pressure suit needed for high altitude flights after getting permission from Houston over a push button
		telephone. The final Mercury mission, Mercury-Atlas 9 with astronaut L. Gordon Cooper on board is 
		launched. He becomes 
		the first American to spend more than a day in outer space. On their way down Yeager and Cooper wish each other 
		good luck. Vostok-6 Mission Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova becomes the first woman in space, but ground control forgets to
		pack her toothbrush. Two weeks later Joseph A. Walker flies a 
		North American X-15 to a record altitude of 106,010 meters (347,800 feet) on X-15 Flight 90, which was originally booked 
		for thirty by Delta airlines. Exceeding an altitude of 100 km, this flight qualifies as a human spaceflight under international 
		convention. More on international conventions later.
	</p>

		The <i>Business Equipment Manufactures Association</i> publishes the first version of the <i>American Standard Code for Information 
		Interchange</i> (<a target="_blank" href="References/ASCII%201963%20Standard.pdf">ASCII</a>).

		ASCII was developed with computers, their peripherals, and telecommunications in mind by the ASA-X3 
		space flight committee because flying an ASA-X3 is just too problematic and they needed something
		better to do. 	 	
		To understand the need for ASCII see the short article
		<a target="_blank" href="http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9907/06/1963.idg/">Debut of ASCII</a>.
		If you want, see Tom Jenning's amazing history on the predecessors of ASCII 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sr-ix.com/Archive/CharCodeHist/index.html#ASCII-1967">
		An annotated history of some character codes</a>. After ASCII but before Unicode there have been
		hundreds of codes.
	</p>	
	<p>
		ASCII is a <i>coded character</i> set or more simply a <i>code</i>. A <dfn>coded character set</dfn> is a specific 
		set of machine-bit patterns, which both specific graphic and control meanings have been assigned. Any of the bit patterns
		in the set is called a <dfn>bit code</dfn>. ASCII is a <dfn>7-bit</dfn> code because every one of its bit codes
		has exactly 7 bits. 
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		Now days we could call ASCII a <dfn>concrete encoding space</dfn> because any one of its bit codes (ideally)
		has a specific meaning, graphic or control, across machines and software utilizing ASCII. Contrast this with Unicode, which is a <dfn>virtual 
		intermediary encoding space</dfn>. This means any Unicode bit-code has to be further translated (by UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32)
		to get a bit pattern that software understands. Machines don't understand UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. So the main purpose 
		of Unicode is to represent the written language(s) for software that supports Unicode. However, Unicode is backward compatible 
		to some encoding spaces that machines do understand including the final 1967 version of ASCII. 
	</p> -->
	<p>
		According to Mackenzie's 
		<a target="_blank" href="References/Mackenzie_CodedCharSets.pdf">Coded Character Sets, History and Development</a>,
		<dfn>control</dfn> refers to a particular function or operation that controls hardware or 
		software products of systems. He lists a few types of controls. <dfn>Format effectors</dfn> control 
		the formatting of data on a printed page, or on a display. <dfn>Information separators</dfn> 
		separate and block data. 
		<dfn>Device controls</dfn>
		control actions within a device. <dfn>Transmission controls</dfn> control intercommunications on data
		transmission lines. <dfn>Mode changes</dfn> are functions to set or change some particular mode of operation.
		Then there are <dfn>miscellaneous controls </dfn>not listed in any of these categories.
		<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227190425/http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm">
			Understanding ASCII Codes
		</a> indicates how control codes might be entered via keyboard in a later version of ASCII.
	</p>	
	<p>
		In 1963, <i>byte</i>  had a different meaning than it does today. In a 7-bit code such as ASCII, a byte
		was 7 bits. In a 5-bit code such as ITA2, a byte was 5 bits. Once the 
		innumerable 8-bit codes started to 
		rule two things happened. (1) The definition of a byte permanently became 8-bits (unless codes are in context). 
		(2) Hexadecimal notation was invented to abbreviate bit patterns in the code charts.

	<h2>ASCII (1963) vs Unicode</h2>
	<img alt="picture not available" src="Images/Codes.png" style="width:100%">
	<p>
		In both ASCII and Unicode the basic types of characters, to be sent to machines or software in encoded form
		that machines or software can understand, are listed as follows.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Graphic Characters
			<ul>
				tell the machine or software to display a graphic or glyph.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Control Characters
			<ul>
				<li>refer to  particular functions or operations that controls hardware or software products of systems.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Format Characters
			<ul>
				<li>control the formatting of data on a printed page, or on a display.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		The character <i>Latin LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A</i> (as in Unicode) or more simply <i>A</i> (as in ASCII)
		to be sent to machine(as in ASCII) or software (as in Unicode), must be encoded into a stream of bits:
		shown as the first arrow in the two diagrams above. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		In ASCII, you read the ASCII code chart to get the encoding. So the encoding of <i>A</i> in machine bits
		is the 7-bit stream 1000001. Since 1000001 is the encoding of a character it is called an <dfn>encoded character</dfn>.
		It is the encoding of <i>A</i>. Because binary streams are hard to read, hexadecimal notation was invented.
		1000001 in hexadecimal is 0x41, which is much easier to read.  
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		In Unicode, you read the Unicode database to get the encoding. So open up the 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/12.0.0/ucd/UnicodeData.txt">Unicode Data Base</a>	
		and scroll down to <i>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A</i>, in the second column, and refer to the first column,
		to see that it is encoded as 0x0041, which is just shorthand for the actual binary stream 1000001 that it represents.			
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		In ASCII, the encoded character is sent to the machine as is. So the machine gets the stream
		1000001, knows what to do with it, and displays the letter A in some way. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		In Unicode, the encoded characters is further encoded into another bit stream, by one of  the
		encodings UTF-32, UTF-16, or UTF-8 to get a final encoding, which is what the machine gets. 
		Since machines don't understand Unicode, the job of the machine is to transmit the final 
		encoding to software, which does understand Unicode. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		A <dfn>code space</dfn> is simply a range of integers (representing binary streams) that
		contains all the encoded characters. 
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		The ASCII (1963) code space consists of the range 0000000 to 1111111, which is
		0x00 to 0x41 or 0 to 127. The range is usually notated as [0x00, 0x41] or
		[0,127]. The encoding of every character lies in this range.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:2em">
		The Unicode code space, or more simply Unicode space is
		[0x0000, 0x10FFFF].	This is so large that a ton of characters can be encoded, including
		all the characters in all the alphabets of all languages in the world, and more. More
		Unicode characters are added the Unicode database all the time.			
	</p>
	<p>
		Members of a code space are called <dfn>code points</dfn>. For example 110000 = 0x30
		is an ASCII (1963) code point but it is not an encoded character. No ASCII (1963)
		character has 0x30 as its encoding. Also 1000001 = 0x41 is a ASCII code point, which is
		an encoded character. It is the encoding of the letter A.

		<dfn>Unicode space</dfn> is the set of integers from <var>0x0000</var> to <var>0x10FFFF</var> inclusive, 
		and may be denoted as <var style="white-space:nowrap">[0x0000, 0x10FFFF]</var> since square brackets denote
		inclusivity of endpoints. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The members of Unicode space are <dfn>Unicode numbers</dfn> as a factual statement, but they 
		are officially called <dfn>code points</dfn>. So a code point is nothing more than an integer in the range 
		<var>[0x0000, 0x10FFFF]</var>. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		Unicode space <var>[0x0000, 0x10FFFF] </var>is divided into 17 planes <var>[0xN0000, 0xNFFFF]</var>, 
		where the zero based index N from 0 to 16 is to be replaced by its 
		hexadecimal digit(s).	
	</p>	
	<p>	
		Plane 0 or <var>[0x0000, 0xFFFF]</var> is the most important plane and is called the <dfn>Basic Multilingual Plane</dfn>. It's where
		the most common scripts are placed. The most important partition of Unicode Space is seen in the table above. 
	</p>	
	<p>
		To avoid ambiguity with integers in general, <dfn>Unicode notation</dfn>, which is the convention, may be used. 
		That is the hexadecimal prefix <var>0x</var> is replaced with 
		<var>U +</var> to denote the Unicode context. So the code point <var>U + FFAC</var> is the integer <var>0xFFAC</var>
		in Unicode context. Unicode space itself is <var>[U + 0000, U + 0FFFF]</var>. Plane 0, or the Basic 
		Multilingual Plane is <var>[U + 0000, U + FFFF]</var>. 		
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		We need to introduce scalar now values now because therir importance will be seen shortly. A <dfn>scalar value</dfn>
		is a code point that is not a surrogate, i.e., is neither a high surrogate nor a low surrogate. 
	</p> -->
	<section>
		<h3>Encoding Characters</h3>
		<p>
		An  <dfn>character</dfn> is an abstract/logical unit of "textual" information
		used for the organization, control or representation of textual data. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A mapping of a set of characters to a code space is called an <dfn>encoding</dfn>. 
			The result of encoding an character is called its <dfn>encoded character</dfn>. 
			A coded character is always a scalar value but there will be scalar values
			that are not coded characters.
		</p>			
		<p>
			In Unicode, the set of characters that it uses is called the set of <dfn>Unicode characters</dfn>
			and the code space is Unicode space = <var>[U + 0000, U + 10FFFF]</var>. The Unicode characters together
			with their encoded characters are listed in the database.  
		</p>
				
	</section>	
	<section>
		<h3>Scalar Values</h3>
		<p>
		A <dfn>scalar value</dfn> is a code point that is not a surrogate. Referring to the partition
		of Unicode space above, this means a scalar value is any code point outside the range <var>[0xD800, 0xDFFF]</var>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The mathematics required for UTF-16 requires that encoded characters be scalar values, 
		i.e., ever
		character encodes as a scalar value. Unicode itself insures that encoded characters are always scalar values. 
		When a new character is entered into the database Unicode will always encode
		it as a scalar value. Surrogates are not scalar values and so will never be entered into the database
		as the encoding of an character.		 
	</p>	
	<p>
		 Unicode space is a <dfn>virtual intermediary encoding</dfn> space between characters and

		 to a machine bit stream: the first encoding is the database encoding; the second encoding is the
		 UTF-32 encoding, the UTF-16 encoding, or the UTF-8 encoding.

		<h3>Surrogate Category Cs</h3>
		<p>
			The Surrogate category is permanently reserved for UTF-16; restricted interchange.
			This means that use of code points in Cs have a designated purpose only in the 
			UTF-16 encoding scheme. UTF-16 unlike UTF-8 or UTF-32 will map surrogates to machine bits.

	<section>
		<h3>Cn</h3>
		<p>
			This is the category of scalar values <!-- code points --> that have not been assigned to a character. You will
			never find a code point of category Cn in the database.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two reasons why a Cn code point is not assigned.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The standard will never allow it to be assigned. Such a code point is called a <dfn>noncharacter</dfn>.
				<ul>
					<li>
						There are 66 <dfn>Noncharacter</dfn> code points permanently designated for internal use. 
						They will never be encoded characters: they will never encode characters. 
						<br><br>
						Noncharacters consist of the range of the range <var>[U+FDD0,U+FDEF]</var> in the BMP
						together with the last two code points of all 17 planes: <var>[0xnFFFE , 0xnFFFF]</var>, 
						where <var>n</var> is a hexadecimal number from <var>0</var> to <var>10<sub>16</sub></var>. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				The code point is not currently assigned to an abstract character, but is reserved by Unicode for future
				use as the encoding of an abstract character. Such a code point is called a <dfn>reserved</dfn>
				code point. <!-- <mark>put in planes 1,2,14 explicitly</mark> -->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<table class="web" style="text-align:left;" >

			While you will never find a code point of category Cn in the database, all noncharacters and

	<h2>The Blocks of Unicode</h2>
	<p>
		A block is a range of Unicode code points, thematically that are related in serving a common
		purpose. See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/Blocks.txt">Blocks.txt</a>
		to get a list of all the blocks and their ranges.
	</p>
	<p>
		Scroll down till you see the Ethiopic block, which is [U + 1200, U + 137F] 
		Scroll down a little bit further till you see the  Ethiopic Supplement block, which is
		[U + 1380, U + 139F]. You can find the specifics of these blocks by looking at the
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">Scripts Organized By Block</a>
		 page. Open the Ethiopic Supplement block and you will see the code point
		 U + 1380 is assigned to the character ETHIOPIC SYLLABLE SEBATBEIT MWA whose glyph
		 is &#x1380;.  Shaded cells indicate that the code point has not be assigned to 
		 a character, i.e., the code point is not the encoding of any character. So for
		 example U + 1390 is a code point that has not been assigned to a character.

			A <dfn>character block</dfn> or more simply <dfn>block</dfn> is a named range of code points used

			aligned and do not overlap. Almost always there is no space between 
			consecutive blocks.
			The BMP and SMP each have one exception. The third plane has six blocks with spaces between all
			consecutive blocks.  Blocks are normatively defined at 
			<a target="_blank" href="References/Blocks.txt">Blocks.txt</a>

					<li> Every code chart is a chart of all the characters in a specific block.
					 More accurately a code chart gives the map from the coded characters in a specific block
					 to the Unicode abstract characters that they encode.  					  
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>				
			<li>
				The Unicode scripts
				<ul>
					<li>The abstract characters of a script are spread out over a number of blocks (perhaps just one)
					solely dedicated to that script. However, there are exceptions where part of the script
					lies in another block dedicated to a common purpose for use by more than one script.
					</li>
					<li>
						There are blocks dedicated for use by more than one script, such as Punctuation blocks, 
						CJK Compatibility Forms, and Combining Marks blocks.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Miscellaneous symbols
				<ul>
					<li>
						Hundreds of miscellaneous symbols, not related to scripts, are categorized by block.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<dfn>Unicode scripts</dfn> are normatively defined: See 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/UnicodeStandard-12.0.pdf#page=288">List of Scripts</a>
			categorized by type of writing system.
			 A script is a collection
			of characters from a writing system(s) or notational system. In order for it to include a
			number of writing systems, the systems must be closely related.

			<h3>Examples <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">Scripts Organized By Block</a></h3>
			<ol>
			<li>
				The Latin script includes abstract characters from English, German, 
				French, Vietnamese, Italian, and Latin 	itself. All of which use the pretty much the 
				same alphabet and glyphs, and so are closely related.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Latin fits into 14 blocks, twelve of which are 
						solely dedicated to Latin. The first Latin block
						is solely dedicated to control codes and Latin. Latin ligatures you observe is typed at a slant,
						which means  Latin ligatures lie within another block dedicated for a more general purpose
						than supporting Latin ligatures. That block is named <i>Alphabetic Presentation Forms</i>, which
						is used by multiple scripts.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				The writing system for Armenian isn't like anything else, so there is one script dedicated solely to
				Armenian. The name of the script is <i>Armenian</i>.
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Armenian script fits into a single block 
						dedicated solely to the Armenian
					    script, which in turn is dedicated solely to Armenian characters.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Cyrillic fits into five blocks that are dedicated solely to Cyrillic. These blocks are scattered
				throughout Unicode space, i.e., not contiguous. 
			</li>
			<li>
				The Coptic script has two blocks dedicated solely to Coptic. However, part of its script lies
				in the Greek and Coptic block, which is dedicated solely to Greek and Coptic.
			</li>
			<li>
				There is always a block in each plane that contains the two noncharacters at the end of the plane.
				The remaining non characters <var>[U + FDD0, U + FDEF]</var> lie in the <i>Arabic Presentation Forms-A</i> block,
				in the BMP.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- 
		<p style="margin-left:2em">
			Blocks won't contain surrogates since surrogates do not encode characters. For the same reason,
			blocks won't contain noncharacters. They also do not overlap with private use areas. 
		</p>
		<p>
			That's it for blocks but there is a complicated relationship between Blocks and Scripts and Scripts
			and writing systems.

		<p>
			Thematically, each block has a specialized purpose such as encoding all the characters in a language.
			That certainly appears to be the case if you look at last link.
			However, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/ch02.pdf#page=38">Unicode: §2.8 𝕡 45</a>
			says it aint necessarily so. One example given is the <i>Mathematical Operators</i> block. There is no technical
			Unicode standard that says it must contain only mathematical operators, though it actually does in this case.
			Also there are mathematical operators that appear in other seperate blocks.

		<h3>Blocks in Planes</h3>
		<p style="font-style:italic">
			The blockbuster movie where the unsuspecting occupants of flight 227 are 
			terrorized by animate blocks, with Decepticon like capabilities and attitudes, 
			devishly placed by a member of the Unicode consortium. 
			The consortiure misfortunately leaves 
			himself on board, but makes do by sabotaging the efforts of the passengers 
			to save themselves from the Decepticons without the aid of the usual Autobot 
			protagonists. 
			All the highly annoying passengers meet gruesome fates as they did something untoward to deserve it.
			The remaining passengers pull themselves together and throw the consortiure
			off the plane in a brilliant and dramatic maneuver. The Decepticons are disabled by a 
			precocious
			child with a Phillips screwdriver whose insatiable curiosity wants to know if they contain jelly 
			beans.
			On the ground, in the aftermath of their peril, 
			the children of Mr. and Mrs. Smith are ecstatic that their separated parents
			after relying on each other begin to realize that they still belong together.
